## Introduction

This report documents the process of requesting a transcript from the Civil
Court Housing Division in Queens, New York.

## Observations

- Court open 9am–5pm
- Paper form needs to be filled in situ
- Form fields: index number, parties’ names, date and hour of requested hearing
- Appeals have additional details to consider.
- Audio recording delivered by email, free. Staff estimated **4–6 weeks**, but
  it actually arrived within a few days.
  - Hearing (and thus the audio recording) lasts ~10 minutes.
- Transcript cost estimated around \$0.50 per minute (approximate, uncertain),
  if requested.

## Discussion

- Process simple:
  - Could be automated online easily.
  - It is possible such automation already exists but is not clearly
    communicated.
- Reported times (4–6 weeks) for receiving the recording were greatly
  overestimated. The recording arrived within a few days.
  - This suggests staff may not have consistent or up-to-date information on
    timelines.

## Conclusion

- Transcript request submitted
- Staff approximated audio delivery in 4–6 weeks, it was actually few days.
- Final transcription cost still approximate at $0.5/page - whole transcript or
  nothing.
- Housing court timing and processes can be improved via more automation.
- Use of AI can provide a pseudo-transcript for free.
