## Introduction

This report summarizes a retail encounter involving a request for an electronic
lighter at a convenience store in an affluent Queens neighborhood.


## Observations

- The customer entered a convenience store in Kew Gardens (ZIP 11415) to buy
  lighters.
- The customer specifically sought **electronic lighters**, distinct from
  traditional mechanical lighters that use a friction wheel.
- The electronic lighter in question uses an electronically generated spark.
- When asked whether the store had electronic lighters, the attendant replied:
  **“No, we don’t have.”**
- Upon looking at the display, the customer observed that the store **did**
  carry electronic lighters.
- The attendant had not acknowledged their presence before the customer pointed
  them out.
- After the customer noted, smiling: *“You don’t know your merchandise, there
  they are, the electronic lighters,”* the attendant appeared slightly upset.
- The attendant then pointed at traditional lighters, not recognizing the
  electronic ones beside them.
- The interaction suggested that the attendant did not identify or distinguish
  the electronic lighters from the mechanical ones.
- Despite the affluent ZIP code, the attendant did not demonstrate engagement or
  interest in assisting beyond the initial response.


## Discussion

The events show that the attendant did not register the requested product even
though it was visible in the display. This lack of recognition persisted even
after the customer identified the correct item.

The encounter appeared to reflect a lack of care either for the store’s
merchandise or for the customer as another person, expressed in the form of low
attention, low engagement, and failure to identify the relevant product.


## Conclusion

Electronic lighters were present in the store, yet the attendant initially
stated they were not. The discrepancy between availability and acknowledgment
was observed directly during the interaction. No explanation was offered by the
attendant.
