We have studied extensively why it is necessary to undo our current vision of
money and our needs. You may have wondered why we spend so much time on undoing
instead of diving straight into presenting the new vision of money this course
promises. The reason is that we need to take a solid first step toward
developing trust in this new vision.

How can you trust something else when all your trust is invested in its
opposite? Think, for example, of car seatbelts. Many years passed after their
invention before they became a mandatory feature in every vehicle, even though
their benefits were well known. Worse still, an even longer time passed in which
people preferred to trust their own experience and not use them. Trust was
placed in one’s own ability to avoid accidents rather than in the obvious
alternative of using the seatbelt.

As was common during my childhood in Venezuela—at least as I remember it—no one
in my family wore a seatbelt. I recall someone at home justifying not wearing it
by saying that in an accident they could hold tightly to the steering wheel and
avoid being thrown forward on impact. Our habit changed at home after an
accident involving my mother and two of my siblings that sent them straight to
the hospital. From then on, it became common sense for all of us to wear the
seatbelt.

The process our mind went through was to completely withdraw the trust we had
placed in our good luck and our ability to avoid accidents, and to place it
instead in what would keep us safe if one happened again. Unfortunately, we
learned that lesson through tragedy. As you can see, in order to trust something
different, it is necessary to stop giving value to the old. This is why we have
spent so much time working on undoing the current vision. To be able to trust
the new vision, we must stop giving value to the things of this world.

It is so crucial that we learn that the things of this world have no value that
the first stage in the development of trust, as explained by the Manual for
Teachers of the Course, consists of a period in which “it seems as if things are
being taken away from us”:

> First, they must go through what might be called a “period of undoing.”
> This need not be painful, but it usually is so experienced. It seems as if
> things are being taken away, and it is rarely understood initially that their
> lack of value is merely being recognized. How can lack of value be perceived
> unless the perceiver is in a position where he must see things in a different
> light? He is not yet at a point at which he can make the shift entirely
> internally. And so the plan will sometimes call for changes in what seem to
> be external circumstances. These changes are always helpful. When the
> teacher of God has learned that much, he goes on to the second stage. [CE M-4.I.3]

It takes a great deal of learning to understand that even “losses” are also
beneficial. Although it may seem difficult, I am sure you have several examples
in mind. Think of something you have lost—perhaps a job or a relationship—and
how that experience of loss resulted in something very positive for your life.

Se me viene a la mente el ejemplo del avión que se estrelló en los Andes en los
años 70. Difícilmente podemos imaginar una situación más trágica y llena de
pérdidas. Sin embargo, los que sobrevivieron cuentan que es una historia de
transformación. Una vez que la tragedia ha sido re-interpretada, lo que queda es
una historia de solidaridad, milagros, amor al prójimo y confianza en Dios. La
historia de esos muchachos ha servido de inspiración para miles de personas. Así
como ese ejemplo, las redes sociales están llenas de ejemplos similares de
personas que lograron ver que sus tragedias resultaron en una bendición.

Lo que nos dice el curso es que este es un paso crucial. En realidad, no creo
que se nos esté quitando las cosas, sino que al dejar de atribuirles valor,
simplemente dejamos de verlas. Como aún no entendemos plenamente que somos
responsables del mundo que vemos, esto luce como que las cosas nos ocurren y la
pérdida llega a nosotros. Sin embargo, estas aparentes pérdidas son muy
beneficiosas, y cuando por fin aprendamos a verlas de esa manera, estaremos
listos para el siguiente paso.

No necesitamos creer por completo que cada cambio es beneficioso, incluso los
que se ven como un pérdida. Es un proceso gradual. En la lección 284, Jesús nos
dice que iremos aceptado este hecho poco a poco, a medida que consideremos esta
idea más seriamente:

> 1 Loss is not loss when properly perceived. ²Pain is impossible. ³There is no
> grief with any cause at all. ⁴And suffering of any kind is nothing but a
> dream. ⁵Such is the truth—at first to be but said; and then repeated many
> times; and next to be accepted as but partly true, with many reservations;
> then to be considered seriously more and more; and finally accepted as the
> truth. ([CE W-284.1:1-5](https://acimce.app/:W-284.1:1-5))

This lesson gives you a practice plan to make the idea of loss impossible in
your mind. The key is to keep the thought “I can choose to change the thoughts
that cause me pain” in your awareness. This is the plan:

1. At first, we only say this idea superficially.

2. “After being repeated many times.” In this second phase we repeat the idea again
and again. It may seem completely useless to do this, but it has a purpose we
will soon see.

3. “It is accepted as partly true, but with many reservations.” Here is the reason
we repeat the idea so many times. If we answer each event of pain or loss with
this idea, we will begin to notice that, at least in some cases, it is true.

4. “Later it is considered more and more seriously.” Because the idea is kept in
mind, it can be considered with more seriousness in each situation that arises.
By considering it seriously, the witnesses to its truth come to our aid and show
us its validity.

5. “And finally it is accepted as the truth.” This is the final goal. Through
practice, the idea can be generalized to every situation because it is the
truth.


## Practice

### In the morning

We will devote 15 minutes this morning to focusing the mind on God as your
strength.

1. Close your eyes and resolve to spend these minutes with God without letting
thoughts interrupt you.

2. Slowly repeat the phrase: “Father, the strength in which I think.”

3. Watch your mind, and if any thought distracts you, confront it by saying: “No,
this is not the thought I want. I want to be with my Father.”

4. Slowly repeat the phrase: “Father, the strength in which I forgive,” and notice
how your mind calms as you center it on a single word.

5. If distracting thoughts come, now confront them with: “Father, the strength in
which I see.”

6. Now repeat, slowly and letting the meaning come alive in your mind: “Father, the
strength in which I trust.”

7. Spend the rest of the time in silence, keeping your mind centered on God as the
only thing you want.


### During the day

Whenever you find yourself in a situation that produces any discomfort, pain, or
sense of loss, slowly repeat to yourself:

> "I can choose to change the thoughts that cause me pain."

Try to consider seriously that this idea may be true in the specific situation
you are in. Very soon, you will surely see the witnesses that will show you that
this idea is the truth.

Every 20 minutes, using your phone’s timer, remind yourself of this phrase:

> "Loss is impossible when it is seen correctly."
