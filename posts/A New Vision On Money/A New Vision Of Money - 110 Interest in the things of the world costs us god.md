When we read that Jesus once said we should sell everything we have and follow
Him, the idea of sacrifice naturally comes to mind. In this world we think that
letting go of the things we possess—such as money—is a sacrifice. However, what
is truly a sacrifice, Jesus tells us, is not releasing the things of this world
that we consider valuable. What is really a sacrifice is the cost of believing
that those things are valuable in the first place.

One of the phrases that has impacted me most in the Course appears in the
supplement The Song of Prayer. There Jesus tells us plainly that any goal we
pursue in this world costs us God Himself. We are sacrificing God in order to
chase after other things we see as “more valuable”:

> It is not easy to realize that prayers for things, for status, for human love,
> for external "gifts" of any kind, are always made to set up jailers and to
> hide from guilt. These things are used for goals that substitute for God, and
> therefore distort the purpose of prayer. The desire for them the prayer. One
> need not ask explicitly. The goal of God is lost in the quest for lesser goals
> of any kind, and prayer becomes requests for enemies. The power of prayer can
> be quite clearly recognized even in this. No one who wants an enemy will fail
> to find one. But just as surely will he lose the only true goal that is given
> him. Think of the cost, and understand it well. All other goals are at the
> cost of God. ([S-1.III.6](https://illuminatemind.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Song-of-Prayer.pdf))

Whenever you find yourself desiring external things, you can be certain that you
have sacrificed God in your mind. We rarely think in these terms. The idea of
sacrificing God may even seem ridiculous to us. On the contrary, it is far more
common to think that God is demanding some kind of sacrifice from you in order
to reach Him. What the Course tells us is that whenever we believe we are
sacrificing something in this world, we should remember that we are sacrificing
what is nothing. From that perspective, there can be no loss at all.

Sacrifice is a fundamental belief for those of us who live in this world. Every
time we hear God’s guidance asking us to do something, we also hear another
voice saying, “Will that sacrifice be worth it?” The things you seem to have to
sacrifice are tangible: your time, money, career prospects, and so on. You
could, for example, spend a few more minutes on Instagram if you didn’t
meditate. This is what the Manual for Teachers is referring to when it says that
it seems we are being asked to sacrifice our best interests for the sake of
truth.

The way we deal with sacrifice varies greatly. There are those who want to live
a hedonistic life and resist sacrifice by allowing themselves as much pleasure
as possible, with a guilt-free attitude. There are also those who, under a
spiritual pretext, seek the same thing. Their justification is that material
abundance and sensory pleasure are their divine right. At the other extreme,
most spiritual traditions make sacrifice something holy, good, and noble. In
fact, the root of the word sacrifice is sacrum, which means “holy.”

I am sure that most who read this have a bit of each attitude I described above.
At times we chase what is pleasurable, at other times we sacrifice ourselves to
purify ourselves (“I ate too much in December and now I’ll diet”), and many
other times we consider material abundance to be what we deserve and therefore
pursue it. If we want to understand why going after things in this world is to
sacrifice God, we must understand very clearly what the Course means by the idea
of sacrifice.

Basically, the Course explains that sacrifice can take two very different forms
of illusion.


## First illusion: giving up things in this world is a sacrifice

The common attitudes we hold regarding sacrifice—including the extremes—all
share the same belief: that giving up things of this world is a sacrifice.

In the Manual for Teachers, the subject of sacrifice is explained very clearly:

> It takes great learning both to realize and to accept the fact that the world
> has nothing to give. What can the sacrifice of nothing mean? It cannot mean
> that you have less because of it. There is no sacrifice in the world’s terms
> that does not involve the body. Think a while about what the world calls
> sacrifice: power, fame, money, physical pleasure. Who is the hero to whom all
> these things belong? Could they mean anything except to a body? Yet a body
> cannot evaluate. By seeking after such things the mind associates itself with
> the body, obscuring its identity and losing sight of what it really is. ([CE M-13.2](https://acimce.app/:M-13.2))

Virtually all of us in this world share the same illusion. Imagine, for example,
that you found a magic lamp. This lamp has a genie that grants any wish. For
instance, being a millionaire, being famous and loved by the public, or any
other pleasure like traveling to every country in the world. If I now asked you
to give up the lamp and not make a single wish, would you listen to me? Most
likely not. Since you still consider those things to have value, it would be a
great sacrifice for you.

However, the previous quote states that the world has nothing to offer. It is so
radical that it is as if I were telling you not to use the magic lamp. Jesus
gives the things of this world a value lower than Monopoly money. If we could
recognize that the things of this world truly have no value, then giving them up
would not involve any sacrifice at all.

How can we move closer to that truth? We first have to recognize that those
things are only valuable for a body. It is the body that can enjoy sensory
pleasures. It is the body that can become famous and that can travel the world.
It is the body that can enjoy money. But a body is nothing in itself without a
mind directing it. Without the mind that gives things meaning, the body really
cannot enjoy anything. You are a mind controlling a body. If you identify with a
body, you are identifying with something that has neither mind nor will.

A body is only a vehicle, not your identity. And if what the world offers only
makes sense for a body, is there really anything the world can offer you, the
one who is driving it? Try to consider these questions with as much seriousness
and honesty as possible. Would you not rather have things that hold more value
and meaning for what you really are?


## Second illusion: sacrifice is the cost of believing in illusions

The second illusion is of a corrective kind. It is still an illusion, but its
purpose is to replace the first illusion. It is an illusion because loss is
impossible in Heaven, which is our reality. Loss, however, can be experienced in
this world. The second illusion is, then, the true meaning of sacrifice:

> What is the real meaning of sacrifice? It is the cost of believing in
> illusions. It is the price that must be paid for the denial of truth. There is
> no pleasure of the world that does not demand this, for otherwise the pleasure
> would be seen as pain, and no one asks for pain if he recognizes it. ([CE M-13.5:1-4](https://acimce.app/:M-13.5:1-4))

Sacrifice does not mean losing the pleasures of this world as a result of giving
them up. Sacrifice is the loss that comes from assigning them value. Sacrifice
is what we miss out on because we are chasing the pleasures of the world.

What do we miss? If we remember that the things the world offers are empty, then
we are giving up our right to find true happiness. It is impossible for what is
empty and nothing to give us happiness. As we studied earlier, we condemn
ourselves to trying to fill the inner emptiness with things that can never fill
it and that leave us even more thirsty.

By going after what we consider valuable in this world, we are giving up all of
God’s gifts. These gifts are freedom, peace, happiness, and His Love. Whenever
you find yourself without peace, depressed, and without love, you can be certain
that you have chosen between what the world offers you and what God wants you to
have. You can also be sure that you have chosen to sacrifice God.

Earlier we said that the central lesson the system we made wants to teach us is
that we are a body, and that the body is cause rather than effect. The cost of
valuing within this system is truly a great sacrifice. By trying to satisfy the
body through the pleasures it seems to demand, we are sacrificing God. And
God—who is love, peace, and happiness—will disappear completely from our
awareness.


## Practice

### In the morning

We will devote 15 minutes this morning to focusing the mind on God as our goal.
For this, we will use the meditation technique the Workbook teaches, in which we
center the mind on the Name of God.

1. Close your eyes and resolve to spend these minutes with God without letting
thoughts interrupt you.

2. Slowly repeat the phrase: “Father, the only thought I have.”

3. Watch your mind, and if any thought distracts you, confront it by saying: “No,
this is not the thought I want to have. I want to be with my Father.”

4. Slowly repeat the phrase: “Father, the only word I have,” and notice how your
mind calms as you center it on a single word.

5. If distracting thoughts come, confront them now with: “Father, the only word I
have.”

6. Now repeat, slowly and letting the meaning of the phrase come alive in your
mind: “Father, the only goal I desire.”

7. Spend the rest of the time in silence, keeping your mind focused on God as the
only thing you want.


## During the day

Throughout the day you will watch your mind to identify desires of any kind.
They may be bodily, professional, family-related, etc. To any goal in which your
body is the central character, respond immediately:

> “God is the only goal I truly desire.”

Let the meaning of these words enter your mind and help you see the need beyond
the bodily desire.

Use your phone’s timer to remind you every 20 minutes that your goal is God:

> “This day I dedicate to God. It is the gift I give Him.”
