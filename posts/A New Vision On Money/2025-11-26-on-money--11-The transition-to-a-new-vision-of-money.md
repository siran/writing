As we have seen so far, the Course places very clear emphasis on the need to
stop valuing the things of this world. This message goes against what the ego
wants us to do. It is opposed to what the world usually tells us our goal should
be. It is also very different from the spiritual messages we hear today that
urge us to create the ideal life we want, including an abundance of money and
other material things. Without a doubt, it can also feel somewhat discouraging
for many.

This is not an entirely new message. It is the same message Jesus brought us two
thousand years ago when he said, “Give everything to the poor and follow me.” A
message that was almost certainly misunderstood and distorted. Yet it is
undeniably a message that has become part of the Western collective unconscious.
Now it is our task to restore its true meaning.

What, then, does the Course propose? Do we really have to sell all our
possessions and dedicate ourselves solely to seeking God? Must we pursue a
minimalist or ascetic life?

Bringing back the quote from Chapter 13 that we used earlier:

> Therefore, ask not of yourselves what you need, for you know not, and your
> advice unto yourself will hurt you. ([CE T-13.VIII.2:4](https://acimce.app/:T-13.VIII.2:4))

> Only the Holy Spirit knows what you need ([CE T-13.VIII.3:1](https://acimce.app/:T-13.VIII.3:1))

As we saw earlier, the reason for delegating all these decisions is that if you
decide on your own what you need, your own guidance will harm you. We are so
confused about what has value and what does not that most of the decisions we
make about it turn against us. The only sane alternative is to let the Holy
Spirit decide for you.

It is obvious that this cannot be achieved without a great deal of trust that
the Holy Spirit will take care of it. For this reason, one of the Course’s goals
is the development of trust. Trust in what? Trust that God, through the Holy
Spirit, will handle the decisions about what things to keep in your life and
what things to let go of better than you can. Trust that God’s plan is better
than yours and that, in fact, it is the only plan that will work.

## The two kinds of trust

In reality, there are two types of trust we must develop. The first is the kind
of trust that assures us that the world is being governed by the Holy Spirit.
This trust tells us that everything that happens is always beneficial and that
nothing occurs by chance. Every small event, every encounter—even those that
seem completely accidental—has been orchestrated by someone who is taking care
of your good.

> The teachers of God have trust in the world because they have learned that it
> is not governed by the laws the world made up. It is governed by a Power That
> is in them but not of them. It is this Power That keeps all things safe. It is
> through this Power that the teachers of God look on a forgiven world. ([CE M-4.I.1:4-7](https://acimce.app/:M-4.I.1:4-7))

The second kind of trust is the most difficult to acquire. It is the trust
involved in delegating to the Holy Spirit the decisions about which things to
keep in your life and which to let go of—about which things are valuable and
which are limiting your progress. The decisions we make day by day are what
determine how our lives look. These decisions determine what becomes part of
your experience and what does not. These are the decisions we must learn to
entrust to the Holy Spirit.

However, what stands in the way of developing trust is the idea of sacrifice, as
we saw in the previous section. We may be used to knowing what we want, but even
this must be questioned and handed over to the Holy Spirit so He can tell us
what truly benefits us.

It is time to make the transition. We have spoken extensively about why it is
impossible for money to make you happy, satisfy you, or sustain you. And
although we have mentioned many times that part of the solution is to delegate
your decisions to the One who truly knows, our study has focused only on the
“deconstructive” aspect of the process. We have studied what we must leave
behind. From now on, we will focus on the constructive aspect of the work we
must do.

The transition to a new vision of money involves two parts. On one hand, you
must place your needs in the hands of the Holy Spirit, and on the other, you
must orient your life toward giving. This is the kind of shift in thinking that
the Course wants us to achieve. We believe that having our needs met is about
getting, but contrary to intuition, it is really about giving.

To begin the transition toward a new vision of money, we must first make sure
you understand what does have value in this world. In the following sections, we
will explore the alternative Jesus offers us.


## Practice

Today we will seek to gain even a glimpse of what the Course means in this
paragraph:

> When this Power has once been experienced [Holy Spirit's Power over the world],
> it is impossible to trust one’s own petty strength again. Who would attempt to
> fly with the tiny strength of a sparrow when the mighty wings of an eagle have
> been given him? And who would place his faith in the shabby offerings of the
> ego when the gifts of God are laid before him? What is it that induces them to
> make the shift? ([CE M-4.I.2](https://acimce.app/:M-4.I.2))


### In the morning

This morning we will meditate for 15 minutes to practice this trust through a
particular example:

1. Close your eyes and quiet your mind for at least 5 minutes.

2. Now think of a situation you are going through that worries you. Notice what
   you feel about the situation and see if you can recognize that you feel fear
   because you do not know what the outcome will be.

3. Then observe your actions and thoughts regarding the situation and look
   honestly at what forces you are trusting in. Do you not feel fear because you
   are relying on your own strength?

4. If you do not like what you feel, then with complete sincerity read these
   words and repeat them in your mind:

> I trust this situation because it is not governed by the laws I myself
> invented.

> This situation is governed by a power that is in me, but does not come from
> me.

> That power is what keeps me safe in this situation.

> Why would I try to fly with the tiny wings of a sparrow when I have been given
> the powerful wings of an eagle?

> I will accept the gift God offers me instead of the little the ego promises.

Use these words until you feel a shift regarding the situation you are facing.
Then spend the rest of the time in silence with God.


### During the day

Watch your mind throughout the day for thoughts of worry or preparation against
future events, even if preparation seems necessary or best for you. Respond to
such thoughts with this phrase:

> "If I am worried, it is because I am trusting in my own strength. Choose now
> to let God take over."

Use your phone’s timer to remind you of this phrase:

> "I place my future in God’s hands."

As always, repeat the phrase slowly, letting its meaning come alive and take
root in your mind. With as much honesty as you can, truly place your future in
God’s hands so that He may take care of it.
