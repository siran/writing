one-sentence-summary: Light slows because electromagnetic waves interfere with phase-delayed secondary electromagnetic fields, making the effective speed of light an emergent, local property of electromagnetic superposition rather than a universal constant.
summary: Polarization is treated as a secondary electromagnetic field rather than a property of matter. Within linear Maxwell theory and linear response, overlapping electromagnetic waves generate phase-delayed secondary fields whose superposition alters phase evolution and yields an effective refractive index. In this framework, electromagnetic waves interact through the total field configuration they jointly create, and the effective local speed of light depends on the electromagnetic energy density of the environment. Refraction, and the associated reduction of light speed, emerges as a consequence of field superposition and delayed response, without invoking particles, atoms, or nonlinear modifications of Maxwell’s equations.

**Summary**

Electromagnetic waves interact through the total field they jointly create.
Polarization is an electromagnetic field, not a material property. Phase-delayed
secondary fields modify phase evolution. An effective, local light speed emerges
from the electromagnetic environment itself.

Goal Explain, within linear Maxwell theory and linear response, how
electromagnetic waves can interact and how an effective local propagation speed
can arise, without introducing matter as a primitive and without adding new
postulates.

**Corollary**

It is true that the maximum speed of light is $c_0$. Additionally, by
the above considerations, $c_0$ is not restricted to a same absolute
value everywhere in the universe. It can be faster, or slower, depending on the
local energy density.


## Derivation

1. Maxwell theory and superposition
In source-free regions, Maxwell’s equations are

$$
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}=0,\qquad \nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=0,
$$

$$
\nabla\times\mathbf{E}=-\partial_t\mathbf{B},\qquad
\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\,\partial_t\mathbf{E}.
$$

These equations are linear: if $(\mathbf{E}_1,\mathbf{B}_1)$ and
$(\mathbf{E}_2,\mathbf{B}_2)$ are solutions, then their sum is also a solution.

Linearity refers to the field equations themselves. It does not constrain how
derived quantities such as energy, momentum, or effective propagation are
constructed.

2. Quadratic field observables
The electromagnetic energy density is

$$
u=\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\left(\mathbf{E}^2+c^2\mathbf{B}^2\right).
$$

For a superposed field $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{E}_2$,

$$
u=u_1+u_2+u_{12},
$$

with the cross term

$$
u_{12}=\epsilon_0\left(\mathbf{E}_1\cdot\mathbf{E}_2+c^2\mathbf{B}_1\cdot\mathbf{B}_2\right).
$$

Thus, when two waves overlap, the local energy–momentum content depends on both
fields. This is already an interaction at the level of physical observables.

3. Polarization written purely as fields
In macroscopic electrodynamics,

$$
\mathbf{D}=\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{P},
$$

with linear response

$$
\mathbf{P}=\epsilon_0\chi\,\mathbf{E}.
$$

Maxwell’s equations do not specify the origin of $\mathbf{P}$. Formally,
$\mathbf{P}$ is simply an additional electromagnetic field proportional to
$\mathbf{E}$.

Interpreted this way:
- $\mathbf{P}$ is a secondary electromagnetic field.
- The constitutive relation $\mathbf{P}=\epsilon_0\chi\mathbf{E}$ is a linear
  field–field relation.
- No ontological distinction between “matter field” and “electromagnetic field”
  is required.

4. Phase delay and effective propagation
In realistic linear response, the proportionality is causal:

$$
\mathbf{P}(t)=\epsilon_0\int_{-\infty}^{t}\chi(t-t')\,\mathbf{E}(t')\,dt'.
$$

In frequency space,

$$
\mathbf{P}(\omega)=\epsilon_0\chi(\omega)\mathbf{E}(\omega).
$$

The secondary field associated with $\mathbf{P}$ is phase-delayed relative
to the primary field.

The total field inside the region is the superposition of:
- the incident electromagnetic wave,
- the secondary electromagnetic wave generated by $\mathbf{P}$.

This phase-delayed superposition produces a shifted phase evolution of the total
wave.

5. Emergence of an effective refractive index
With $\mathbf{D}=\epsilon(\omega)\mathbf{E}$, where

$$
\epsilon(\omega)=\epsilon_0\left[1+\chi(\omega)\right],
$$

Maxwell’s equations yield the wave equation

$$
\nabla^2\mathbf{E}-\mu_0\epsilon(\omega)\partial_t^2\mathbf{E}=0.
$$

Plane-wave solutions satisfy

$$
k^2=\mu_0\epsilon(\omega)\omega^2,
$$

so the phase velocity is

$$
v_p(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon(\omega)}}=\frac{c_0}{n(\omega)},\qquad
n(\omega)=\sqrt{1+\chi(\omega)}.
$$

Thus the reduced propagation speed follows directly from interference with a
phase-delayed secondary electromagnetic field.

6. Two-wave interaction
Let the total field be

$$
\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{E}_2.
$$

By linearity of the response,

$$
\mathbf{P}=\epsilon_0\chi(\mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{E}_2)
          =\epsilon_0\chi\mathbf{E}_1+\epsilon_0\chi\mathbf{E}_2.
$$

Each wave generates a secondary electromagnetic field, and both secondary fields
contribute to the total $\mathbf{D}$ field.

Therefore, in an overlap region, each wave propagates in an environment
determined by the combined electromagnetic configuration, not by its own field
alone.

7. Local effective light speed
Because the effective permittivity depends on the total field configuration, the
local phase velocity depends on the local electromagnetic energy density:

$$
u(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\left(\langle\mathbf{E}^2\rangle+c^2\langle\mathbf{B}^2\rangle\right).
$$

The effective refractive index can be expressed as a function of this density,

$$
n(\mathbf{x})=\sqrt{1+\chi(\mathbf{x})},
$$

and the local propagation speed is

$$
c_{\text{local}}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{c_0}{n(\mathbf{x})}.
$$

8. Consequence
Different regions of the universe, characterized by different electromagnetic
field configurations and energy densities, naturally exhibit different effective
propagation speeds. No modification of Maxwell’s equations is required. No
additional postulates are introduced. Only the interpretation of polarization as
a secondary electromagnetic field is changed.
