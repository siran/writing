Our egos tell us, “I do not have time for others now; I must focus on my goals.” But the truth is that our goals mean nothing without others. More so, they are easily achieved through others, as a logical, obvious consequence of helping them. By prioritizing others, we are clearly selfishly helping ourselves. It helps everyone to be selfish in this way: selfishly focusing on others’ well-being.</p><p name="6355" id="6355" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we all give to others, since we are others’ “other,” it follows that our environment will shower us with much-welcome presents.</p><h4 name="9d39" id="9d39" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">To Give Is to Receive</h4><p name="9aff" id="9aff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If we all give to others in need, it follows logically that we will receive help when we need it.
