The misery of possessing things</h3><figure name="1a02" id="1a02" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-fMX4xNk6Z8HrhEE-jlIDg.png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-fMX4xNk6Z8HrhEE-jlIDg.png"></figure><p name="66ea" id="66ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Let’s revisit the topic of possession. We previously discussed the belief that if we do not accumulate piles of money and inflate the number in our bank accounts, we will be at the mercy of those forces that want to take our lives. The idea of possessing and accumulating is the logical consequence of the belief that there is a limited supply and infinite needs. Under this belief, we think that unless we possess and accumulate, the needs of others will overtake us, leaving us with nothing. Possessions, therefore, become highly valued because they can be used for exchange and give us a sense of safety.</p><p name="5301" id="5301" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Possession, exemplified by money, can become an end in itself, rather than a means to meet needs. In other words, possessions become a measure of the “self.” When you see someone with a lot of money, through the things they wear, the car they drive, the trips they take, don’t you think that person is “more” than you? We are convinced that the more possessions one has, the better one is.</p><p name="68aa" id="68aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The logical conclusion is that to reach that level where others are, you must focus your efforts on buying and owning more and more things. What we don’t realize is that the ego has a plan behind this. In chapter 13, we find a good explanation of the ego’s plan:</p><blockquote name="8cb5" id="8cb5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Ownership is a dangerous concept, if it is left to you. The ego wants to have things for salvation, for possession is its law. Possession for its own sake is the ego’s fundamental creed, a basic cornerstone in the churches that it builds unto itself. And at its altar, it demands you lay </em>all<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> of the things it bids you get, leaving you no joy in them. ( </em><a href="https://acimce.app/:T-13.VIII.1:7-10" data-href="https://acimce.app/:T-13.VIII.1:7-10" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">CE T-13.VIII.1:7–10</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">)</em></blockquote><p name="568f" id="568f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Most religions in the world contain the idea of sacrificing something to god or gods. Usually, when we think of sacrificial rituals, we think of someone sacrificing a lamb. It’s a cruel idea, not just for the poor animal. In ancient times, a lamb was a luxury item. The lamb could be used for its meat, its wool, for reproduction once it matured, and also for trade for other goods. However, the god to whom the sacrifice was offered demanded that the lamb be completely lost.</p><p name="3bd7" id="3bd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This paragraph takes us back to that time to show us how unjust and cruel it was to sacrifice something valuable at the whim of a god. Then it shows us that by “placing on its altar all the things it orders you to obtain,” we are elevating the ego to the same category as a god. The ego is not something external, nor a living entity, yet we think it is. It is the ego, your desire to be separate, that orders you to obtain things only to sacrifice them on its altar.</p><p name="9914" id="9914" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seems like an abstract and useless idea. But once you see the effects of this idea in your world, it will be obvious to you. How do we sacrifice what the ego asks us to obtain on its altar? The reasons were studied in the previous section. If the ego asks you to obtain things to elevate your “self,” to make you more special, then the things you possess will be destined for that purpose and not for your happiness. Elevating your “self” and making you more special is the idea of standing out.</p><p name="4aad" id="4aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Standing out sounds like a wonderful idea. Your mind tells you, “that’s where happiness lies!” But the idea of standing out is the idea of being in a separate class, and this idea is ultimately the idea of being alone. Just like those who sacrificed a lamb, when you obtain things with the purpose dictated by the ego, you will also be sacrificing them and ending up with nothing.</p><p name="50f0" id="50f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For this reason, always distrust what you tell yourself you need:</p><blockquote name="e6ef" id="e6ef" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Everything that the ego tells you that you need will hurt you. For although it urges you again and again to get, it leaves you nothing, for what you get it will </em>demand<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> of you. And even from the very hands that grasped it, it will be wrenched and hurled into the dust, for where the ego sees salvation it sees </em>separation<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">, and so you lose whatever you have gotten in its name. Therefore, ask not of yourselves what you need, for you know not, and your advice unto yourself will hurt you. For what you think you need will merely serve to tighten up your world against the light, and render you unwilling to question the value that this world can really hold for you. ( </em><a href="https://acimce.app/:T-13.VIII.2" data-href="https://acimce.app/:T-13.VIII.2" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">CE T-13.VIII.2</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">)</em></blockquote><p name="064a" id="064a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Here, we see once again the idea of ‘miswanting.’ Additionally, it describes a process that the ego uses to ensure there is no joy in anything you possess. It is a truly fascinating process. This process explains many experiences I have had with possessions. I am sure you have experienced it as well. I simplify it here to make it more obvious:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="e828" id="e828" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The ego makes you believe that possessing things is your happiness.</li><li name="9f6e" id="9f6e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It tells you to go and buy things to be happy.</li><li name="2985" id="2985" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">But then it asks you to place those things on its altar, depriving you of the joy they would bring.</li><li name="e593" id="e593" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Then it snatches those things from your hands and throws them into the dust.</li><li name="be8a" id="be8a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It repeats the process.</li></ol><p name="1e52" id="1e52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This process was ‘immortalized’ in the famous saying that there are two moments of happiness in a man’s life: the day he buys a boat and the day he finally sells it. The idea behind this saying is that every man longs to have his own boat, but once he gets it, he realizes how much maintenance and trouble owning a boat brings. The only way to regain happiness is to get rid of the boat.</p><figure name="ecdf" id="ecdf" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*bqkxtN6vrHdoeIPV" data-width="1400" data-height="1050" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bqkxtN6vrHdoeIPV"></figure><p name="12cd" id="12cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Think of a personal example of something you always wanted, but once you obtained it, it wasn’t what you imagined. Perhaps it turned out to be more work than you wanted, or it came with so many problems that you couldn’t enjoy it. Maybe it was something so fleeting that you barely had time to enjoy it.</p><p name="20cd" id="20cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my case, there have been many trips I have taken in my life. I desire these trips in my heart, but the process of preparation, planning, and even being at the destination, I often realize that I have little time to truly enjoy the trip itself. When I finally get accustomed to the place, the trip is about to end, and I start feeling nostalgic for the days I spent there.</p><p name="5c11" id="5c11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And who hasn’t experienced obtaining something they really wanted, only to realize it didn’t bring as much happiness as expected? I have lived through this more than once, and when others ask how I feel about this new possession, I feel obliged to say I am very happy, even when I didn’t feel any different.</p><p name="18b7" id="18b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ve likely also had the experience of possessing many things and, in the process, feeling like the things possess you. You become a sort of slave to your own possessions, having to work for them by maintaining or solving problems they bring. This reminds me of my mother’s beach apartment, where every time we visited, the air conditioning was broken. So, the first day of every beach vacation was spent running errands-finding someone to fix the AC, paying for electricity, paying for water, and discovering that the pool wasn’t working. The next time, it was always the fridge that was broken, or a window letting in the salty air.</p><p name="902a" id="902a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The conclusion to all of this is that the desire to possess, when controlled by the ego, leads us to desire things that will end up hurting us. It does this by ensuring they become problems for you, preventing you from fully enjoying them. Normally, one would think the solution to the problem is to rid yourself of any thoughts that cause conflict, guilt, or pain so you can enjoy your possessions. However, Jesus explains that the problem begins when you believe you know what you want.</p><p name="9fd9" id="9fd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a very emphatic way, Jesus tells you not to ask yourself what you want, because you don’t know. The answer you give yourself will cause harm.</p><p name="57da" id="57da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, we will spend about 15 minutes getting in touch with the reality of what we have tried to possess, we have placed on the ego’s altar, which has deprived us of the joy it promised:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b44d" id="b44d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Close your eyes and prepare your mind to search honestly.</li><li name="4454" id="4454" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Search your mind for examples of things you possess or have possessed, of goals and achievements.</li><li name="75f0" id="75f0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Honestly review how you placed each of these things on the ego’s altar.</li><li name="4a9c" id="4a9c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reflect on how there was no complete joy in them.</li><li name="aa72" id="aa72" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Finally, say to each of these things:</li></ul><blockquote name="94b1" id="94b1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“I now place this possession on Your altar, Father, so You may return to me what You truly want me to have.”</em></blockquote><p name="a7d0" id="a7d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Imagine truly giving each of these things to God’s light, and receiving back a gift that brings you relief. When you can no longer find anything else in your mind, use the silence to be with God for a few more minutes. End with this phrase:</p><blockquote name="04f5" id="04f5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“I leave all my needs to God today. Under His guidance, my journey will be light and without obstacles.”</em></blockquote><p name="79e0" id="79e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">As you can see, this first part of the series to question them and give them to someone who truly knows what is best for you. Today, we will continue developing this skill.</p><p name="1bdf" id="1bdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whenever you notice that you are desiring something from this world, no matter how much you believe you need or want it, say as honestly as you can:</p><blockquote name="7777" id="7777" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Holy Spirit, give me what I need in this situation because only You know what it is.”</em></blockquote><p name="8c4d" id="8c4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Set the timer on your phone to remind you every 20 minutes of the last part of that phrase:</p><blockquote name="d042" id="d042" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Holy Spirit, only You know what I need.”</em></blockquote></div></div></section>
