However, I believe there is an opportunity to make this platform even more inclusive and supportive of writers, particularly those who prefer to keep their stories freely accessible.</p><p name="1190" id="1190" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Currently, the only way for writers to earn money on Medium is by placing their stories behind a paywall. While I understand the need for a sustainable business model, I think it is crucial to recognize that free, not paywalled content still generates significant value for Medium. These stories attract readers, keep them engaged, and contribute to the overall vibrancy of the platform. They create a positive feedback loop where free content draws in readers who may then be enticed to explore more of the premium content.</p><p name="67df" id="67df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally, it is a waste of time for people who just want to read and learn without shelling out their money. These readers might be one-time visitors who do not want to subscribe but still seek valuable content. I want everybody to read my content and share in the part of Medium’s pie that is generated by sheer traffic.</p><p name="d29a" id="d29a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given this, I firmly believe that writers who choose to share their work for free should also have a share of the pie. After all, they are contributing to the ecosystem that makes Medium a thriving community of ideas and creativity. By offering writers the ability to earn money without paywalling their content, Medium could encourage more diverse voices and ideas to flourish, benefiting both the platform and its users.</p><p name="345d" id="345d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Personally, I do not want to place a paywall on my stories. I believe in the value of open access to information and ideas. Yet, like many others, I also appreciate the small rewards that can come from sharing my work — whether it is the satisfaction of knowing my words have resonated with others or the simple pleasure of enjoying a cup of coffee that a popular story might afford me.</p><p name="9804" id="9804" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In conclusion, I urge Medium to consider a system that allows writers to earn money for their free content. Such a change would not only empower writers but also enhance the richness of content available on the platform, ultimately creating a more dynamic and inclusive environment for all.</p><p name="207e" id="207e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sincerely,</p><p name="5b87" id="5b87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">An and ChatGPT</p></div></div></section>
