The work I was been paying to do drifted from my interests. My life also got very complicated, for a multitude of reasons.</p><p name="baf7" id="baf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can describe the feeling of being laid off as taking off a leash — I feel free now to do as I please, when I please, to pursuit my interests at the whim of my desires.</p><p name="fc44" id="fc44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Note: not that I didn’t feel free before; I have always done as I please; however, I do have cherish and respect promises, responsibilities, and expectations.)</p><p name="7de7" id="7de7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Roaming the streets at 10am, just wandering around if you like, is a magical realization of what is possible.</p><p name="40ca" id="40ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To have your personal interests first in line, not the company’s…</p><p name="a46e" id="a46e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No more shenanigans from my manager, boss or colleagues. No more breakfast during, before or after standup meetings; no nonsense meetings anymore, either. #win</p><p name="23ab" id="23ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Time is human’s most valuable asset. Use it or lose it.</p><p name="dbc5" id="dbc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Better to use it to improve the world by making people happy, and making you happier in return, than to inflate some bank account.</p><h3 name="f509" id="f509" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">And what about the money?</h3><p name="d22f" id="d22f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I am excessively grateful for having had been offered the opportunity to join my former company in such an amazing position; company’s values were great, as well as work environment and peers.</p><p name="62bd" id="62bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under the mentorship of my manager, I was set up for success from the beginning. I was able to grow from a junior position (actually mid-level) to a senior level engineering and junior manager in a couple of years.</p><p name="2e4a" id="2e4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the beginning I had no work history in the US, and so, I do appreciate them for believing in me in that the story laid in my CV was truthful and that I could do what I said in my CV.</p><p name="b907" id="b907" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having such a position helped me not to suffer much directly from inflation since I enjoyed yearly appropriate salary hikes, good healthcare insurance, 401k, legal, almost 30 days PTO… The pay was not astronomical, 6 figures on the very low range.</p><p name="a6ec" id="a6ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I never complained. I was happy.</p><p name="5eac" id="5eac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The day I was laid of, I had woken up with the idea of asking my manager for a raise: ends were not meeting with much grace.</p><p name="9d79" id="9d79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also felt that I wasn’t been paying sufficiently enough so I could offload my life’s shenanigans to a 3rd party; which would have helped.</p><p name="20f6" id="20f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Life turned into overwhelming mode and something had to be adjusted.</p><p name="d775" id="d775" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather than overworking myself with life+work responsibilities, I decided to deal with my life and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">time </strong>first, and let the work for other’s bank account fall into it’s right place. Which it did, and I got laid off. Haha.</p><p name="28a7" id="28a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got a 6 week severance package. I was quite happy at the moment (since I didn’t know anything about this, I thought I would be thrown out in the cold; however, I felt and was prepared for it), until realizing engineers at Google<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>get 6 months (some random YouTube video). Haha. My manager also then confessed he got a yearly bonus and I never got any.</p><p name="bfd1" id="bfd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, as in China, I truly believe all the salaries a company pays should be available for at least all employees to see and compare. The secrecy — and even the contractual obligation not to talk about it — gives company&#39;s an unfair advantage over employees.</p><h3 name="cac1" id="cac1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Yeah, but how do you plan to pay rent?</h3><p name="e525" id="e525" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The money is indeed an issue that can’t be ignored, AT ALL. I am cognizant of the fact. I have some savings so I hope I will be able to manage it without tumultuous changes.</p><p name="eb8f" id="eb8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Desperation mode has not ever helped anyone. And <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">plans are useless but planning is everything</em> as Eisenhower once said.</p><blockquote name="ba96" id="ba96" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable.</blockquote><blockquote name="0d4f" id="0d4f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Dwight D.

It’s like being hungry, but you are not sure which food to eat first.</p><p name="b466" id="b466" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For this, meditation is key, I’ve come to believe.</p><p name="6038" id="6038" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I find it is key to know ourselves and be sure of what we truly want. See more clearly the path we want to walk.</p><p name="dc89" id="dc89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seems as if there are many choices… but that’s a topic for another moment.</p><p name="d27d" id="d27d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things I could explore:</p><h4 name="db7a" id="db7a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">AI</h4><p name="3204" id="3204" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">2023 has been an amazing year in terms of AI. So that it’s perhaps one of the things I might look more into (so many different paths, I know).</p><p name="83cb" id="83cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have a bunch of ideas that I could explore. I’ll be writing about them as I actually walk the walk.</p><h4 name="3bd8" id="3bd8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Phone-2-phone + no-internet payment wallet (with <a href="https://cardano.org/" data-href="https://cardano.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cardano</a>)</h4><p name="6ae7" id="6ae7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’m also toying with the idea of entering the cryptocurrency developer area, by building a phone-2-phone no-internet payment wallet with <a href="https://cardano.org/" data-href="https://cardano.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cardano</a>, using <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/" data-href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hydra</a>.

It extends Bitcoin’s UTxO to make an <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">extended UTxO, or eUTxO.</em> To my surprise, Cardano is not the only one doing this.</p><blockquote name="d63d" id="d63d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">eUTXO stands for extended unspent transaction output and is used by several other notable blockchains such as Cardano, Komodo and Nervos Network. By comparison, the Ethereum network uses the Account model as the framework for recording transactions on the blockchain.</blockquote><h4 name="1117" id="1117" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">Research</h4><p name="1c47" id="1c47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I studied physics in college, so I have the researcher vein running though me.</p><p name="aff7" id="aff7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am currently working on a very interesting research project aimed at measuring the speed of planet Earth through the “Ether”.

I never found a solid strategy other than buy-and-hold, however it’s fun to try. Interesting to study also.</p><p name="8d33" id="8d33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Doing arbitrage might sound old, but there might be opportunities still our there.</p><p name="0d39" id="0d39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taken from <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp" data-href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Investopedia</a>:</p><blockquote name="1f4c" id="1f4c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">What Is Arbitrage?</blockquote><blockquote name="52c8" id="52c8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same or similar asset in different markets in order to profit from tiny differences in the asset’s listed price.
