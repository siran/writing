This is the opposite of the “let your profits run” mindset, which attempts to optimize positive trading results by increasing the size of winning</p></blockquote><p>As mentioned in my <a href="https://medium.com/@mrodz/algo-trading-algorithms-to-beat-the-market-ccad674258b0">first article</a>, the use of margin might be useful to further increase the profits (or losses) made with a scalping strategy.</p><p>Doing manual scalping might be a time-intensive and stressful activity, since you have to keep track of all the charts for the stocks you care. And buy/sell many times at the right moments.</p><p>Imagine doing all submitting all those BUY and SELL orders as seen in the figure above. Doing that manually, with many stocks, is virtually impossible.</p><p>A computer can do this hard work for you. Faster and better.</p><h1>Let a computer do the hard work for you</h1><p>Algo Trading is a very handy and simple way to exploit the scalping strategy.</p><p>With Algo Trading, you can do a simple script that buy or sells a stock when certain condition are met. This happens as frequently as you want: many times a day, a minute or whatever.</p><p>The idea is to build a script that buys and sell as many times as possible, making a small profit as often as possible.</p><p>Scalping is just a general mindset of what we want to do. But we still need some indicator or signal of when to buy or sell.</p><h1>The concept of “mean reversion”</h1><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:null,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Alt The price fluctuates around the average.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Alt The price fluctuates around the average." title="Alt The price fluctuates around the average." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBJc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7138a0c-7e45-4362-9d71-7c95733f5265_1400x788.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><p>In case it’s not already clear by the image above, Investopedia defines “mean reversion” as:</p><blockquote><p>Mean reversion is a theory used in finance that suggests that asset prices and historical returns eventually will revert to the long-run mean or average level of the entire dataset.</p></blockquote><p>This means that the price of a stock will in general tend to “revert” to its average price.</p><p>That is, if a price suddenly hikes we would expect it to return to a lower value. Also, if a price suddenly drops we would expect it to return to a higher value.</p><p>We can use this idea to have buy signals.

From 9.9% to 30.2%.</p><pre><code>AAPL - market change: 1.099
AAPL - wallet change: 1.302
</code></pre><p>If you also download the data for FTEC and V and run the script using</p><pre><code>SYMBOLS = ["AAPL", "V", "FTEC"]
</code></pre><p>you would also obtain good profits over a Buy and Hold strategy:</p><pre><code>AAPL - market change %: 1.099
AAPL - wallet change %: 1.302
AAPL - num_transactions: 454
...
V - market change %: 1.032
V - wallet change %: 1.049
V - num_transactions: 290
...
FTEC - market change %: 1.145
FTEC - wallet change %: 1.298
FTEC - num_transactions: 390

My goal will be to determine if there’s a moment common to most stocks were the market started growing so much in 2019.</p><p>Any ideas? Would be glad to read your comments on ways to improve this.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-knowledge/algo-trading-backtesting-an-intraday-scalping-strategy-with-a-simple-custom-script-fcd15642555">Full article here</a></p><p><em><a href="https://dev.to/michrodz/algo-trading-backtesting-an-intraday-scalping-strategy-3337">This post is also available on DEV.</a></em></p>
