Whose name is actually Aristocles. Plato is only his wrestling nickname, because of his broad shoulders.</a></em></p><p>It is not that I stopped wanting to write.</p><p>I somehow feel I have too much to say and yet I am not sure if anyone would want to read my words.</p><p>I am told very frequently by “my circle” that I write too much (in chats). Or that what I say is not important to them. Or that it has been thought and said and written before.</p><p>That didn’t discourage me. If anything, it makes me write more.</p><p>It’s about what I was saying to myself but that Cammi made me want to change.</p><p>It really doesn’t even matter if I like what I write. Or if I find it useful.</p><p>Writing is about others, most of the time.</p><p>((I know, it seems I am contradicting myself (see <a href="https://anrodriguez.substack.com/i/141773528/why-write">Why write?</a>). But I am not. I just realized the importance of others in my life. You reach yourself through others. It’s about seeing the reflection of my words in others, perhaps. But it is also a way to show myself to me and to others.))</p><p>Even if this is a bad article, it might inspire someone to write something better.</p><p>So, as I was telling her in the comments, it is a good thing to strive for to make a dent in someone else’s life.</p><p>A bad dent, a good dent. Only time can tell.</p><p>(is there such a thing as a bad dent? I don’t think so.)</p>
