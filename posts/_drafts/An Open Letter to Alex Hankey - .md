one-sentence-summary: We examine whether phenomena historically labeled as telepathy or telekinesis can be discussed meaningfully within classical Maxwell electromagnetism, without invoking nonphysical forces or violating known constraints.
summary: This open letter addresses claims of biological electromagnetic influence at a distance, reframing them strictly within source-free Maxwell theory. We distinguish mechanical force from cumulative bias, clarify the role of coherence and geometry, and identify which forms of influence are forbidden, allowed, or experimentally open under classical electromagnetism. No appeal is made to nonphysical primitives, quantum indeterminacy, or violations of causality.

# An Open Letter to Alex Hankey

Dear Alex,

We write to you in the spirit of precision and shared concern for clarity at the
boundaries of physics.

The questions motivating this letter are simple to state:

- Can biological systems exert electromagnetic influence beyond their immediate
  boundaries?

- Can phenomena historically labeled *telepathy* or *telekinesis* be discussed
  without abandoning classical electromagnetism?

- What strictly follows from applying source-free Maxwell theory consistently to
  biological systems?

This letter makes no appeal to nonphysical forces, consciousness as a primitive,
or violations of known physical law.

It assumes only what Maxwell electromagnetism already assumes: continuous
fields, local interactions, superposition, and conservation.

The conclusions are modest, but nontrivial.


## What is being examined

The question under examination is narrow and well defined:

Can classical electromagnetic fields emitted by biological systems produce
nonzero, cumulative, or biasing effects on other systems, consistent with
source-free Maxwell theory?

This question has a precise mathematical meaning and does not require
speculative extensions of physics.


## The factual baseline: biological systems radiate

There is no controversy on the following points:

- Neural activity involves time-varying ionic currents.
- Cardiac activity involves macroscopic current loops.
- Any time-varying current radiates electromagnetic fields.
- These fields propagate according to Maxwell’s equations.

Biological electromagnetic fields exist and have been measured. This is
established experimental fact.

The relevant question is therefore not *whether* such fields exist, but *how*
weak fields interact with complex environments over time.


## Force versus bias

A persistent source of confusion in this domain is the conflation of *force*
with *influence*.

Maxwell theory draws a clear distinction:

- A weak field cannot impose large accelerations.
- A weak, structured field can nevertheless bias ongoing dynamics.

Bias is not control by force. It is control by constraint.

This distinction is standard in physics and engineering:

- phase-sensitive detection,
- lock-in amplification,
- resonance selection,
- cumulative drift under repeated weak coupling.

A system need not be overpowered to be steered.


## On noise and ignorance

Thermal or environmental “noise” is often treated as fundamentally random.

In a Maxwellian ontology, this is a modeling convenience, not a law of nature.

What is called noise is unresolved superposition of many deterministic field
contributions with unknown phases and geometries.

This matters because bias does not compete with background activity in amplitude
alone. It competes in phase space and coupling geometry.

A weak, coherent signal can persist in the presence of overwhelming incoherent
background when the interaction channel is selective.


## What Maxwell theory allows

Within classical electromagnetism:

- Electromagnetic fields exert influence everywhere charges or currents exist.
- Even small forces can bias ongoing dynamics.
- Bias integrated over time can produce measurable drift.
- Drift does not require deterministic override.

These statements are not speculative. They follow directly from Maxwell’s
equations applied carefully.

What Maxwell theory does **not** provide is:

- instantaneous influence,
- influence without coupling,
- control without feedback,
- violation of causal propagation limits.


## Causal loops and imprint formation

Source-free Maxwell theory permits closed circulation of electromagnetic energy.

Such circulation naturally gives rise to **causal loops**: configurations in
which emitted fields influence the conditions of future emission through
geometry, boundary interaction, or reabsorption.

Causal loops are not exotic. They appear in:

- resonant cavities,
- waveguides,
- oscillators,
- self-organizing field structures.

When a system’s own field contributes to shaping its future dynamics, an
**imprint** is formed.

Nothing in Maxwell theory forbids imprint formation. Maxwell theory is agnostic
to it.


## Steering without determinism

The existence of causal loops does not imply magical control.

A loop may steer without overriding, bias without dictating, and constrain
without commanding.

This distinction is essential.

Steering arises from repeated weak coupling, phase sensitivity, and feedback
geometry. It does not require large forces or violations of conservation.

If influence exists, it must take this form.


## Language discipline

Terms such as *will*, *intention*, or *miracle* obscure rather than clarify.

We avoid them.

The only admissible variables here are:

- currents,
- fields,
- phases,
- coherence,
- geometry,
- coupling.

Anything else is metaphor.


## Relation to causal-loop frameworks

A general, architecture-independent formalism for imprint-based causal loops
exists (Rodriguez & Palma, 2025). It defines steering and self-recognition
without invoking nonphysical primitives.

We do not rely on that framework here.

We note only that it is compatible with the physical picture described in this
letter and provides a separate, higher-level language for discussing imprint and
feedback when needed.


## Experimental posture

This letter does not claim empirical confirmation.

It does claim that certain experimental questions are well posed:

- Can structured low-frequency electromagnetic sources bias the long-term
  behavior of sensitive systems?
- Does geometry or phase coherence matter more than amplitude?
- Can repeated weak coupling produce cumulative drift over long integration
  times?

These questions admit controlled tests.


## Closing

This letter is not an argument for belief.

It is an argument for clarity.

Source-free Maxwell electromagnetism is a complete, deterministic field theory.
Applied consistently, it already constrains what biological systems can and
cannot do at a distance.

What remains is experimental and conceptual work, not new physics.

We offer this letter in that spirit.
