one-sentence-summary: Interference disappears in which-way experiments because a detector necessarily rotates one of the contributing wave vectors, causing the two geometric histories to diverge and fail to intersect.
summary: >
  The disappearance of interference in which-way two-slit experiments is often
  attributed to observation, information, or measurement. In this work, the
  phenomenon is explained using only vector geometry and energy considerations.
  Treating detectors as physical devices with activation thresholds, we show that
  any functioning detector necessarily rotates the wave contribution associated
  with the monitored slit. We redefine interference not as mere addition, but as
  geometric intersection. Since rotated lines starting from the same origin diverge
  immediately, they fail to intersect at the screen. The mystery dissolves into
  a simple geometric fact: divergent lines do not overlap.

# 1. What needs explaining

In the double-slit experiment, a single electron sent one at a time produces a
double-slit interference pattern.

When a which-way detector is placed at one slit, the interference disappears,
even if the detector does not fire.

This effect is often presented as mysterious and explained using abstract ideas
such as information, observation, or measurement. Standard interpretations
suggest that the mere "availability of information" causes the wave to collapse.

We show that none of this is needed. The loss of interference is a necessary
consequence of physical laws, specifically the geometry of vector spaces and the
conservation of energy.

# 2. The wave as a geometric line

Treat the electron's history as a line (a vector) in complex phase space.

With two slits open, the electron explores two histories simultaneously:

- the left slit contributes a vector $\vec v_L$,
- the right slit contributes a vector $\vec v_R$.

The observable phenomenon of interference is not simply the sum of these
vectors; it is their **geometric intersection** (or overlap). The interference
term in quantum mechanics ($\psi_L^* \psi_R$) is mathematically a dot product,
which measures how much one vector lies along the other.

# 3. When interference exists

Interference is the **coincidence** of two histories.

Geometrically, two lines starting from the same origin (the source) intersect
continuously at all subsequent points only if they are **parallel** (i.e., they
are the same line).

- If $\vec v_L$ and $\vec v_R$ are parallel (colinear), they overlap
  everywhere. They reinforce each other (constructive interference) or cancel
  (destructive interference) depending on their relative length.
- If they are parallel, they form an "I" shape in vector space.

This parallel alignment is the strict requirement for interference.

# 4. What a detector physically is

A detector is a physical device, not an abstract observer.

For a detector to function, it must distinguish between "signal" and "noise."
This distinction requires an **activation threshold**. A device without a
threshold would trigger continuously on thermal noise and vacuum fluctuations.

A threshold is an energy barrier. To cross it, the electron must perform work or
exchange energy with the device.

Therefore:

> **Any functioning detector necessarily introduces an interaction that costs
> energy.**


This is not optional. It is the defining physical characteristic of a detector.

# 5. What an interaction does to a vector

Any interaction that involves energy necessarily changes the state of the wave.
In quantum mechanics, energy $E$ is directly linked to the phase
evolution rate $\omega$ by the relation $E = \hbar\omega$.

Changing the energy of a wave changes its phase evolution. In vector terms,
phase evolution is a **rotation**.

Therefore, the interaction with the detector applies a torque to the vector:

- The vector $\vec v_L$ (passing the detector) is rotated by an angle
  $\theta$.
- The vector $\vec v_R$ (passing the empty slit) is not rotated.

The magnitude of this rotation depends on the interaction energy, but the fact
of the rotation is unavoidable.

# 6. The key geometric fact: "V" vs "I"

Consider two lines starting at the origin.

- **Scenario A (No Detector):** The angle between them is $\theta = 0$. They
  are parallel. They overlap continuously. They form an "I". **Interference
  exists.**
- **Scenario B (With Detector):** The angle between them is $\theta \neq 0$.
  They diverge immediately. They form a "V".

If one vector is rotated by **any** nonzero angle—even a fraction of a
degree—the two lines coincide only at the single point where they started (the
source). At every subsequent point, including the detection screen, they are
spatially separated in vector space.

A rotated line does not "partially" intersect. It misses entirely. Interference
is not reduced smoothly; it is geometrically impossible for divergent lines to
overlap.

# 7. Why interference disappears

At the screen, the physical observable is the squared magnitude of the wave.
Mathematically, this includes the intersection (dot product) of the two vectors.

After a detector rotates one contribution:

$$
\text{Intersection}(\vec v_L, \vec v_R) = \vec v_L \cdot \vec v_R = 0
$$

Therefore:

- the histories do not touch,
- there is no geometric overlap,
- the interference term vanishes.

Nothing is blocked. Nothing is destroyed. The vectors simply no longer line up.
The total intensity becomes the sum of two non-intersecting contributions:

$$
|\vec v_L|^2 + |\vec v_R|^2
$$

This matches the observed "clump" pattern of single-slit diffraction.

# 8. Why the rotation is not undone

To restore interference, the system would need to force the divergent lines to
cross again. This requires "undoing" the rotation (applying a counter-torque of
$-\theta$).

However, applying a specific rotation against the potential requires **Work**
(Energy). There is no free mechanism in the vacuum that perfectly
counter-rotates a vector to fix a misalignment caused by a detector.

So the system proceeds along the path of **Least Energy**: it allows the
divergence to persist rather than spending energy to fix it.

# 9. Holograms and phase detection

Consider a hologram. It records the phase of light by interfering an object beam
with a reference beam.

- If the reference beam is coherent (parallel in phase space) with the object
  beam, the hologram forms.
- If you slightly shift the frequency (energy) of the reference beam, the vector
  rotates. The lines diverge. The hologram vanishes.

This disappearance is not because the hologram "knows" the frequency changed. It
is because the geometric intersection required to record the pattern no longer
exists. The which-way detector is simply a frequency-shifter that breaks the
hologram of the electron.

# 10. Which-way detection clarified

The standard paradox asks: "How does the electron know to stop interfering just
because we might know which path it took?"

The answer is: It doesn't know.

The "knowledge" is obtained by a physical mechanism (the detector). That
mechanism requires an energy threshold. That threshold imposes a phase rotation.
That rotation creates geometric divergence.

The loss of interference is not caused by the knowledge; it is caused by the
**mechanism required to obtain the knowledge**. You cannot touch the system to
measure it without rotating the vector.

# 11. The least-energy principle (“the lazy electron”)

The electron does not choose between "particle behavior" and "wave behavior." It
does not decide to collapse.

It simply follows the geometric lines defined by its energy state. When the
lines diverge, it follows them apart.

To force them back together would require an expenditure of energy that the
electron does not possess. It is a "lazy" system: it follows the path of least
resistance, which in this case leads to a loss of interference.

---


# 12. Conclusion

The which-way two-slit experiment contains no paradox. It is a demonstration of
vector geometry.

Interference disappears because:

1.  Detectors must have energy thresholds to function.
2.  Thresholds imply energetic interactions.
3.  Energetic interactions rotate state vectors.
4.  Rotated vectors diverge and fail to intersect.

The mystery dissolves into a simple geometric fact: **Parallel lines meet;
divergent lines do not.**
