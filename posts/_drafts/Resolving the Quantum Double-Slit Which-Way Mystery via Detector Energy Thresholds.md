one-sentence-summary: Interference disappears in which-way experiments because a detector necessarily rotates one of the contributing wave vectors, and rotated vectors no longer add except at a single point.
summary: >
  The disappearance of interference in which-way two-slit experiments is often
  attributed to observation, information, or measurement. In this work, the
  phenomenon is explained using only wave superposition, vector geometry, and
  energy considerations. Treating detectors as physical devices with activation
  thresholds, we show that any functioning detector necessarily rotates the wave
  contribution associated with the monitored slit. Since interference requires
  pointwise vector alignment, this rotation prevents the vectors from adding
  except at the point where they were identical. Interference vanishes not because
  paths are known or observed, but because rotated vectors no longer match. The
  mystery dissolves into simple geometry and energy accounting.

# 1. What needs explaining

In the double-slit experiment, a single electron sent one at a time produces a
double-slit interference pattern.

When a which-way detector is placed at one slit, the interference disappears,
even if the detector does not fire.

This effect is often presented as mysterious and explained using abstract ideas
such as information, observation, or measurement.

We show that none of this is needed.

# 2. The wave as a vector field

Treat the electron as a wave.

At every point on the screen, the wave is represented by a vector.

With two slits open:

- the left slit contributes a vector $\vec v_L(x)$,
- the right slit contributes a vector $\vec v_R(x)$.

The total wave at point $x$ is their vector sum:

$$
\vec v_{\text{total}}(x) = \vec v_L(x) + \vec v_R(x)
$$

The observed intensity depends on the length of this sum.

# 3. When interference exists

Interference exists only if the two vectors point in the same direction.

If $\vec v_L(x)$ and $\vec v_R(x)$ are aligned:

- they add,
- the total vector is larger,
- bright fringes appear.

If they are opposite:

- they cancel,
- dark fringes appear.

This is ordinary vector addition. No interpretation is involved.

# 4. What a detector physically is

A detector is a physical device.

For it to work, it must not fire continuously. That means it must have a
threshold.

A threshold is an energy barrier. Without it, noise would trigger the device
constantly.

Therefore:

> Any functioning detector necessarily introduces an interaction that costs
> energy.


This is not optional. It is what makes a detector a detector.

---


# 5. What an interaction does to a vector

Any interaction that costs energy changes the wave.

In vector terms, it rotates the vector. The rotation is in the internal
direction of the wave, not in ordinary space.

This is unavoidable:

- energy exchange takes time,
- time evolution rotates vectors.

So if a detector monitors the left slit:

- $\vec v_L(x)$ is rotated,
- $\vec v_R(x)$ is not.

---


# 6. The key geometric fact

Two vectors that start aligned:

- match everywhere only if they remain aligned.

If one vector is rotated by any nonzero angle:

- the two vectors coincide only at the point where they were identical,
- at every other point, they point in different directions.

A rotated vector does not partially match. It misses.

This is not gradual. It is geometric.

Interference is not reduced smoothly by misalignment; it exists only when
vectors share a common direction and disappears as soon as they do not.

---


# 7. Why interference disappears

At the screen, vectors are added point by point.

After a detector rotates one contribution:

$$
\vec v_L(x) \not\parallel \vec v_R(x)
$$

Therefore:

- the vectors do not add,
- there is no shared direction,
- the interference term vanishes.

Nothing is blocked. Nothing is destroyed. The vectors simply no longer line up.

The total intensity becomes:

$$
|\vec v_L(x)|^2 + |\vec v_R(x)|^2
$$

This is the sum of two non-interfering single-slit contributions.

# 8. Why the rotation is not undone

Undoing a rotation requires another rotation.

That means another interaction. That costs energy.

The detector already consumes energy just to be ready. There is no free
mechanism that rotates the vector back into alignment.

So the system proceeds along the least-energy path: it does not undo the
rotation.

---


# 9. Holograms and phase detection

A hologram does detect phase.

It does so by converting vector direction into fixed spatial structure. That
conversion costs energy and leaves a permanent mark.

Once phase becomes structure:

- the vector is no longer free to add,
- interference is gone.

This is not a flaw. It is exactly how phase detection works.

---


# 10. Which-way detection clarified

A which-way detector does not remove interference by knowing the path.

It removes interference by rotating one of the vectors.

The rotation is required for the detector to function. The loss of interference
is a consequence of geometry.

---


# 11. The least-energy principle (“the lazy electron”)

The electron does not choose. It does not decide. It does not know.

It simply adds vectors.

And it never spends energy to rotate one back just so they can line up again.

---


# 12. Conclusion

The which-way two-slit experiment contains no paradox.

Interference disappears because:

- detectors have thresholds,
- thresholds imply interactions,
- interactions rotate vectors,
- rotated vectors no longer add.

The mystery dissolves into simple geometry and energy accounting.
