one-sentence-summary: We show that the phenomena historically attributed to spacetime curvature can be derived from curved electromagnetic energy propagation in flat space, without modifying Maxwell’s equations or reifying geometry.
summary: This document disentangles mathematical formalism from physical interpretation in the treatment of light deflection and gravitational phenomena. Starting strictly from source-free Maxwell theory and energy continuity, we demonstrate that curved trajectories arise from structured electromagnetic propagation, not from curvature of space itself. We show that Maxwell’s equations require no geometric deformation to remain valid, that curved propagation is sufficient to explain observed effects, and that interpreting these effects as spacetime curvature is an optional, not necessary, inference.

## Maxwell and Einstein — Interpretation vs. Mathematics

## 1. The question we are actually asking

The historical question is usually phrased as:

> *Does mass curve spacetime?*


This document asks a different and more precise question:

> *Do the observed phenomena require space itself to be curved, or are they
> fully explained by curved propagation of energy in flat space?*


This distinction matters.

Curvature of **paths** is not the same as curvature of **space**. A curved
trajectory does not, by itself, imply a curved geometry.

Our goal is not to dispute mathematical predictions. It is to examine whether
the **interpretation** attached to those predictions is forced.


## 2. What Maxwell theory actually says

Source-free Maxwell theory consists of:

* Local field evolution
* Energy continuity
* Finite propagation speed
* No geometric postulates about space itself

The equations describe how electromagnetic energy **moves**.

They do **not** say:

* that space bends,
* that distances deform,
* that geometry responds dynamically to energy.

Maxwell theory is **agnostic** about geometry beyond assuming a differentiable
manifold on which fields are defined.

This neutrality is crucial.


## 3. Energy transport is the primitive observable

In this program, the primitive observable is not “field value” but **energy
transport**.

Energy transport is described operationally by:

* energy densit, u,
* energy flux, S,
* continuity: dt(u) + div(S) = 0

This equation does not mention curvature of space. It accounts only for **where
energy goes**.

Nothing in it distinguishes “straight space” from “curved space.”


## 4. Curved propagation does not require curved space

A trajectory can curve for many reasons:

* refraction,
* waveguiding,
* interference with background fields,
* self-interaction via secondary fields,
* constrained topology.

All of these occur in flat Euclidean space.

A simple example: Light bends in a gradient-index medium. No one concludes that
the medium has curved geometry.

The path is curved. The space is not.

This logical separation is often forgotten.


## 5. The refraction analogy is not an analogy

In conventional dielectrics:

* an incident electromagnetic wave induces secondary electromagnetic fields,
* the total field evolves more slowly or along altered directions,
* the resulting trajectory bends.

Crucially:

> The incident wave does not interact with “matter.”
> It interacts with **another electromagnetic field**.


Matter is a *source* of secondary fields, not a new force.

In the Maxwell Universe framework:

* all interactions are field–field interactions,
* matter is a stable electromagnetic configuration,
* refraction is a universal mechanism, not a special case.

There is no conceptual leap here.


## 6. Light interacting with light

In vacuum, electromagnetic waves superpose linearly.

But **observables are quadratic**.

When a propagating field overlaps with another structured field:

* energy density redistributes,
* phase evolution changes,
* effective propagation direction bends.

No nonlinearity is required. No modification of Maxwell is required. No
spacetime curvature is required.

The bending is a property of **energy flow organization**.


## 7. The Sun as a structured electromagnetic environment

Near a massive object like the Sun:

* there exists a large, structured electromagnetic energy distribution,
* this distribution acts as a background field,
* incident light propagates through this background.

The light trajectory bends because:

* local energy transport is redirected,
* not because space itself is bent.

This is curved **propagation**, not curved **space**.


## 8. Why Maxwell survives everywhere

Maxwell’s equations are local.

They:

* do not require global flatness,
* do not depend on embedding geometry,
* propagate energy consistently wherever fields exist.

If spacetime curvature were intrinsic and dynamical:

* Maxwell’s equations would need modification or coupling terms,
* energy transport rules would vary by location,
* observable electromagnetic behavior would differ near massive bodies.

We do **not** observe this.

Electromagnetism behaves the same everywhere.

This is not an approximation. It is an empirical fact.


## 9. The problem with “local flatness”

The usual defense is:

> “Spacetime is curved, but locally flat.”


This is not an explanation. It is a workaround.

Curvature is **intrinsic**, not coordinate-dependent.

A curved manifold is not equivalent to a flat one, no matter how small the
patch.

If local flatness were sufficient:

* curvature would have no physical consequences for local dynamics,
* geometry would be observationally redundant.

You cannot both claim curvature is real *and* that it disappears locally in
every measurement.


## 10. What Einstein’s equations actually do

Einstein’s field equations relate:

* a geometric object (the metric),
* to an energy–momentum tensor.

This is a **mathematical identification**, not a derivation.

The equations do not prove that space *is* geometry. They encode gravitational
effects **as if** geometry responds.

This is an interpretive choice.

A powerful one. But not a logically forced one.


## 11. Why the eclipse prediction does not decide the issue

The famous eclipse measurement confirms:

> Light bends near the Sun by a specific amount.


It does **not** confirm:

* that space is curved,
* that geometry is dynamical,
* that Maxwell is incomplete.

The same bending follows from:

* structured electromagnetic propagation,
* energy-dependent refraction,
* continuity-constrained flow.

Multiple mechanisms predict the same trajectory.

Observation alone does not choose the ontology.


## 12. Why flat space is sufficient

In the Maxwell Universe framework:

* all dynamics occur in energy flow,
* curvature belongs to trajectories, not geometry.

Flat Euclidean space:

* supports curl,
* supports divergence-free flow,
* supports knots and circulation,
* supports stable structures,
* supports curved propagation.

Nothing more is required.


## 13. What “speed” really means here

Transport requires a rate.

This is not an imposed limit. It is a structural necessity.

Energy cannot propagate without a characteristic speed.

Hyperbolic kinematics arise because:

* transport is causal,
* curl dynamics are rotational,
* composition of transport is constrained.

This produces Minkowski-like structure **in motion**, not in space.


## 14. Interpretation vs mathematics

Both Maxwell and Einstein predict correct phenomena.

The difference is not in equations. It is in **what is claimed to be real**.

* Maxwell: energy flows, paths curve.
* Einstein: space curves.

Only one of these is directly observed.

We observe:

* energy,
* motion,
* trajectories,
* interactions.

We do not observe geometry acting.


## 15. What this document does — and does not — claim

This document claims:

* curved propagation is sufficient,
* Maxwell theory survives unchanged,
* spacetime curvature is not required.

It does **not** claim:

* Einstein was “wrong” mathematically,
* general relativity is useless,
* geometric methods are invalid.

It claims geometry is **descriptive**, not ontological.


## Closing statement

Light bends.

Paths curve.

Energy reorganizes.

None of this requires space itself to curve.

The mathematics allows both readings. The physics requires only one.

Curved propagation is observed. Curved space is inferred.

This document separates the two.
