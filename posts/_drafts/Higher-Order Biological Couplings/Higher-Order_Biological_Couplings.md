# Higher-Order Biological Couplings
## A Standalone Maxwellian Framework for Sensitivity to Change, Curvature, and Anticipation

---

**One-sentence summary:** Biological systems couple not only to signals, but to changes of signals and changes of changes; higher-order temporal structure enables ultra-subtle, low-energy influence amplified near criticality, fully consistent with Maxwellian physics.

## Abstract

Living systems are extended electromagnetic current distributions whose activity is inherently time-structured. Classical Maxwell electrodynamics maps this structure linearly into surrounding fields, preserving frequency and phase relationships. Biological receivers, however, do not respond to total field energy; they respond selectively through projections, integration, adaptation, and nonlinear regulation.

This document presents a first-principles framework showing that biological systems couple not only to signal levels, but to changes, changes of changes, and higher temporal derivatives of structured electromagnetic inputs. These higher-order couplings drastically increase selectivity, suppress amplitude dependence, and enable anticipatory bias when regulatory subsystems operate near critical transitions. The framework explains intuition, affective communication, coordination, and agency as deterministic consequences of derivative-sensitive coupling, without invoking nonlocality, new physics, or symbolic information.

## 1. Motivation

Most physical models assume that influence scales with magnitude: force, power, or energy. This assumption fails for living systems.

Biological systems are not passive detectors. They are active, adaptive, nonlinear regulators that emphasize structure over magnitude and change over level. Crucially, they often respond most strongly not to what *is*, but to how something *begins to change*.

## 2. Minimal Physical Assumptions

We assume only:

1. Maxwellian electrodynamics holds in biological environments.
2. Biological systems generate time-varying currents $J(x,t)$.
3. Field propagation is linear for small perturbations.
4. Receivers are selective, responding through projections rather than power.
5. Regulatory dynamics are nonlinear and adaptive.
6. Near-critical regimes exist, where susceptibility is high.

No stochastic postulates are required.  
No new physical entities are introduced.

## 3. From Sources to Structured Fields

Let a biological system generate currents $J(x,t)$. Maxwell’s equations define a linear mapping

$$
(E,B) = \mathcal{M}[J].
$$

Because the mapping is linear, any temporal structure in $J(t)$ produces corresponding structure in the field. By Fourier decomposition,

$$
J(t) \leftrightarrow J(\omega).
$$

Time structure implies frequency and phase structure exactly.

## 4. Receiver Selectivity: Projection Before Power

A biological receiver does not measure total field energy. Instead, it computes a projection

$$
z(t) = \mathcal{K}[E(t),B(t)],
$$

where $\mathcal{K}$ encodes geometry, tissue coupling, and internal transduction.

## 5. Hierarchy of Coupling Orders

Define a hierarchy of receiver sensitivities:

- Zeroth order (level):
$$
z(t)
$$

- First order (change):
$$
\dot z(t)
$$

- Second order (curvature):
$$
\ddot z(t)
$$

- Higher order:
$$
z^{(n)}(t) = \frac{d^n z}{dt^n}.
$$

Each order corresponds to a distinct physical filter.

## 6. Why Higher Order Means More Subtle and More Powerful

Differentiation suppresses steady backgrounds, rejects brute-force amplitude, and amplifies fine temporal structure. Coherent structure survives differentiation; incoherent noise does not.

---

## 7. Receiver Dynamics with Higher-Order Inputs

The most general regulatory model is

$$
\dot X = F(X) + \sum_{k=0}^{N} \lambda_k z^{(k)}(t).
$$

Near criticality, higher-order terms dominate while adaptation suppresses lower orders.

---

## 8. Criticality and Anticipation

Near a dynamical transition,

$$
\chi_k = \frac{\partial X}{\partial z^{(k)}} \gg 1.
$$

Higher-order derivatives encode direction before motion. Anticipation arises without prediction.

---

## 9. Adaptation as Order Elevation

Adaptation removes steady components and forces ascent to higher-order coupling.

---

## 10. Intuition Reinterpreted

Intuition corresponds to dominant higher-order derivatives $z^{(k)}$ for $k \ge 2$. The system detects incipient change without symbolic representation.

---

## 11. Information Without Symbols

Information exists if structured input reliably biases outcomes. Higher-order structure carries directional information without symbols or entropy measures.

---

## 12. Experimental Signatures

Predictions include curvature sensitivity, phase dominance, collapse under smoothing, peak effects near decision thresholds, and bias reversal under curvature inversion.

---

## 13. Central Claim

Biological systems influence each other primarily through sensitivity to higher-order temporal structure, not through force or power.

---

## 14. Closing Statement

The most decisive signals do not push. They arrive just early enough to bend what would have happened anyway.
