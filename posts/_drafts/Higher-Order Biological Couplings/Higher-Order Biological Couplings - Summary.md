one-sentence-summary: Biological systems couple not only to signals, but to changes of signals and changes of changes; higher-order temporal structure enables ultra-subtle, low-energy influence amplified near criticality, fully consistent with Maxwellian physics.

# Abstract

Living systems are extended electromagnetic current distributions whose activity
is inherently time-structured. Classical Maxwell electrodynamics maps this
structure linearly into surrounding fields, preserving frequency and phase
relationships. Biological receivers, however, do not respond to total field
energy; they respond selectively through projections, integration, adaptation,
and nonlinear regulation.

This document presents a first-principles framework showing that biological
systems couple not only to signal levels, but to *changes*, *changes of
changes*, and higher temporal derivatives of structured electromagnetic inputs.
These **higher-order couplings** drastically increase selectivity, suppress
amplitude dependence, and enable anticipatory bias when regulatory subsystems
operate near critical transitions. The framework explains intuition, affective
communication, coordination, and agency as deterministic consequences of
derivative-sensitive coupling, without invoking nonlocality, new physics, or
symbolic information.

# 1. Motivation

Most physical models assume that influence scales with magnitude: force, power,
or energy. This assumption fails for living systems.

Biological systems are not passive detectors. They are active, adaptive,
nonlinear regulators that emphasize *structure over magnitude* and *change over
level*. Crucially, they often respond most strongly not to what *is*, but to how
something *begins to change*.

This document formalizes that fact.

# 2. Minimal Physical Assumptions

We assume only:

1. **Maxwellian electrodynamics** holds in biological environments.
2. **Biological systems generate time-varying currents** \(J(x,t)\).
3. **Field propagation is linear** for small perturbations.
4. **Receivers are selective**, responding through projections rather than
   power.
5. **Regulatory dynamics are nonlinear and adaptive**.
6. **Near-critical regimes exist**, where susceptibility is high.

No stochastic postulates are required. No new physical entities are introduced.

# 3. From Sources to Structured Fields

Let a biological system generate currents \(J(x,t)\).

Maxwell’s equations define a linear mapping: \[ (E,B) = \mathcal{M}[J] \]

Because the mapping is linear, any temporal structure in \(J(t)\) produces
corresponding structure in the field.

By Fourier decomposition: \[ J(t) \;\longleftrightarrow\; J(\omega) \]

**Time structure implies frequency and phase structure exactly.**

---


# 4. Receiver Selectivity: Projection Before Power

A biological receiver does not measure total field energy.

Instead, it computes a **projection**: \[ z(t) = \mathcal{K}[E(t),B(t)] \]

where \(\mathcal{K}\) encodes geometry, tissue coupling, and internal
transduction.

This step is decisive:
- power-based descriptions already fail here,
- structure is preserved,
- phase matters.

---


# 5. Hierarchy of Coupling Orders

Define a hierarchy of receiver sensitivities:

- **Zeroth order** (level): \[ z(t) \]

- **First order** (change): \[ \dot z(t) \]

- **Second order** (curvature): \[ \ddot z(t) \]

- **Higher order**: \[ z^{(n)}(t) = \frac{d^n z}{dt^n} \]

Each order corresponds to a distinct physical filter.

---


# 6. Why Higher Order Means More Subtle and More Powerful

Differentiation has three crucial effects:

1. **Suppresses steady backgrounds**
2. **Rejects brute-force amplitude**
3. **Amplifies fine temporal structure**

Coherent structure survives differentiation; incoherent noise does not.

Thus:
- zeroth order favors magnitude,
- higher order favors *timing and shape*.

---


# 7. Receiver Dynamics with Higher-Order Inputs

The most general regulatory model is: \[ \dot X = F(X) + \sum_{k=0}^{N}
\lambda_k z^{(k)}(t) \]

Key facts:
- coefficients \(\lambda_k\) depend on state,
- near criticality, higher-order terms dominate,
- adaptation suppresses lower orders over time.

**Biological systems dynamically climb the order hierarchy.**

---


# 8. Criticality and Anticipation

Near a dynamical transition: \[ \chi_k = \frac{\partial X}{\partial z^{(k)}} \gg
1 \]

Higher-order derivatives encode *direction before motion*.

Thus:
- systems respond before large changes occur,
- bias appears without force,
- anticipation emerges without prediction.

This is physics, not foresight.

---


# 9. Adaptation as Order Elevation

Adaptation removes steady components:
- subtract mean → kill zeroth order,
- subtract trend → kill first order,
- suppress curvature → force higher sensitivity.

Adaptation is not noise suppression. It is **forced ascent to higher-order
coupling**.

---


# 10. Intuition Reinterpreted

Intuition corresponds to dominant higher-order terms: \[ z^{(k)}, \quad k \ge 2
\]

The system detects *incipient change* without symbolic representation.

This explains why intuition:
- is fast,
- is vague,
- precedes explanation,
- collapses under overload.

---


# 11. Information Without Symbols

Information exists if: \[ \text{structured input} \;\Rightarrow\; \text{reliable
bias in outcome} \]

No symbols are required. No entropy is required.

Higher-order structure carries *directional information*.

---


# 12. Experimental Signatures

Higher-order coupling predicts:

1. Identical signals up to first order diverge in effect when curvature differs.
2. Phase and timing dominate over power.
3. Excess smoothing destroys influence.
4. Effects peak near decision thresholds.
5. Bias reverses under curvature inversion.

No amplitude-based theory predicts these.

---


# 13. What This Framework Rejects

- Influence requires large energy transfer.
- Noise forbids subtle effects.
- Biology is a power detector.
- Communication must be symbolic.

All are false under higher-order coupling.

---


# 14. Central Claim

> Biological systems influence each other primarily through sensitivity to
> higher-order temporal structure, not through force or power.


This follows directly from Maxwellian physics plus biological dynamics.

---


# 15. Closing Statement

The most decisive signals do not push. They arrive just early enough to bend
what would have happened anyway.

That is higher-order biological coupling.
