one-sentence-summary: We identify the Cosmic Microwave Background not as a thermodynamic relic, but as the measured electromagnetic energy density of the vacuum state; equating the energy of a maximally expanded flux loop to this background density recovers the electron's Compton scale as a resonance limit.
summary: Standard physics requires a "Big Bang" to explain the energy scale of matter. We propose a steady-state alternative based on the "Start Big" principle. The vacuum is populated by electromagnetic flux loops at the limit of expansion (the CMBR scale). Matter arises from the compression of these vacuum loops. By comparing the measured energy density of the background vacuum to the energy density of a trapped knot, we derive the electron's Compton wavelength as the fundamental topological scaling limit. No Boltzmann statistics or expanding spacetime are required—only the continuity of energy density across scales.

## 1. The "Start Big" Ontology

We reject the assumption that the universe began as a singularity (Small/Hot)
and expanded.

We adopt the **Maxwell Steady-State** view:
1.  **The Vacuum is the Default:** The baseline state of the universe is a sea
    of electromagnetic flux loops expanded to their maximum coherence size.
2.  **Matter is Compressed Vacuum:** Particles are not added to the universe;
    they are local regions where the vacuum flux has been twisted and compressed
    into knots.
3.  **Evolution is Compression:** To create structure, one must do work to
    compress the diffuse vacuum field into a localized knot.

Therefore, the properties of the **Electron** (the simplest knot) must be
mathematically relatable to the properties of the **Vacuum** (the simplest loop)
via a scaling law.


## 2. The Measured Variables

We use only experimentally verified quantities, treating "Temperature" merely as
a label for Energy Density.


### A. The Vacuum (The Expanded State)

The "Cosmic Microwave Background" is the measurement of the vacuum's baseline
energy density.
* **Measured Density ($u_{vac}$):**
  $\approx 4.17 \times 10^{-14} \text{ Joules/m}^3$.
* **Characteristic Wavelength ($\lambda_{vac}$):** The peak of the background
  spectrum is $\approx 1.9 \text{ mm}$ ($1.9 \times 10^{-3}$ m).


### B. The Electron (The Compressed State)

The electron is the simplest stable knot.
* **Rest Energy ($E_e$):**
  $\approx 8.18 \times 10^{-14} \text{ Joules}$.
* **Characteristic Radius ($R_e$):** To be determined.


## 3. The Scaling Derivation

We posit that the Electron and the Vacuum Loop are the same topological object
in two different phase states: **Compressed** vs. **Expanded**.


### The Energy-Size Relation

For a topological soliton of fixed winding number (a single loop), the total
energy $E$ is inversely proportional to its linear size
$R$ due to tension:

$$
E \propto \frac{1}{R}
$$

This gives us a conservation law across scales:

$$
E_{vac} \cdot R_{vac} = E_{e} \cdot R_{e} = \text{Constant}
$$


### Determining the Constant

We can solve for the electron radius $R_e$ if we know the other three
terms.

1.  **$E_e$ (Electron Energy):** $8.18 \times 10^{-14}$ J (Known).
2.  **$R_{vac}$ (Vacuum Scale):** $1.9 \times 10^{-3}$ m (Measured peak
    of CMBR).
3.  **$E_{vac}$ (Vacuum Energy):** The energy of a single vacuum loop.
    Since the vacuum is a "sea" of these loops, the energy of one loop is simply
    the energy contained in its own volume at the vacuum density.
    $$E_{vac} \approx u_{vac} \cdot R_{vac}^3$$
    $$E_{vac} \approx (4.17 \times 10^{-14}) \cdot (1.9 \times 10^{-3})^3$$
    $$E_{vac} \approx 2.8 \times 10^{-22} \text{ Joules}$$

*(Note: This matches the energy of a single photon at the CMBR peak frequency,
$hf$, without invoking quantum axioms. It is purely geometric energy
content).*


### Solving for the Electron Radius ($R_e$)

Using the scaling law $E_e R_e = E_{vac} R_{vac}$:

$$
R_e = R_{vac} \left( \frac{E_{vac}}{E_e} \right)
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
R_e \approx (1.9 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times \left( \frac{2.8 \times 10^{-22} \text{ J}}{8.18 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J}} \right)
$$

$$
R_e \approx (1.9 \times 10^{-3}) \times (3.4 \times 10^{-9})
$$

$$
R_e \approx 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \text{ meters}
$$


## 4. The Result: The Compton Scale

The derived radius ($6.5 \times 10^{-12}$ m) is on the exact order of magnitude
of the **Compton Wavelength** ($\lambda_c \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-12}$ m).

The geometric discrepancy (factor of $\sim 2.7$) is expected given we
modeled the vacuum loop as a simple cube/sphere without accounting for the
precise toroidal geometry factors.

**Conclusion:** We recover the size of the electron from the properties of the
vacuum background **without** $k_B$, without Quantum Mechanics, and
without a Big Bang.

* **The Vacuum** is the state of Maximum Radius / Minimum Energy.
* **The Electron** is the state of Minimum Radius / Maximum Energy (for that
  specific topology).
* The scaling ratio between them is governed by simple geometric tension
  ($E \propto 1/R$).


## 5. The Limit of Stability

Why does the compression stop at $10^{-12}$ m? Why doesn't it collapse to
a point?

As derived in *String Theory in a Maxwell Universe* (Mercer, 2026), the
stability of the knot relies on **Refractive Self-Trapping**.

$$
n = 1 + \chi u
$$

As the knot compresses, $u$ increases, and $n$
increases. However, if the knot compresses *too* much (approaching
$10^{-15}$ m), the energy density gradient becomes so steep that the
refractive index cannot maintain the smooth toroidal flow required for stability
(the "Dielectric Breakdown" of the vacuum).

The **Compton Scale** represents the "Sweet Spot" (Resonance) where the tension
of the knot exactly balances the refractive confinement allowed by the vacuum's
dielectric properties.


## 6. Closing Statement

The universe did not cool down to create electrons. The electron is a standing
wave resonance of the current vacuum. Its size is determined by the energy
density of the background field ($u_{vac}$) and the geometric law of flux
conservation.
