# What Follows from Source-Free Maxwell Theory

## Introduction

Source-free Maxwell theory is one of the most successful descriptions in the
history of physics. It was abstracted directly from experiment, refined through
observation, and tested across an enormous range of scales. Its equations are
linear, local, and precise.

And yet, Maxwell theory is usually treated as incomplete.

Mass, inertia, gravity, confinement, and the existence of stable objects are
typically regarded as phenomena that require additional postulates: particles,
forces, spacetime curvature, or quantum axioms. Electromagnetism is then placed
inside a larger theoretical structure, rather than examined on its own terms.

This article takes a different approach.

We ask a single question:

What follows if we take source-free Maxwell theory seriously, and nothing else?

No particles are postulated. No spacetime structure is assumed. No quantum
principles are introduced. No mechanical laws are added.

Only the experimentally abstracted content of Maxwell electromagnetism is used.

The result is that many structures usually treated as fundamental emerge
naturally: effective light-speed variation, inertial mass, rest frames,
confinement, and string- or membrane-like organization. None of these are
assumptions. All follow from continuity, geometry, and topology of
electromagnetic energy flow.


## What is actually assumed

We have to assume the assumption of *something* (not hard), and allow this
*something* to be described as a configuration of electromagnetic energy.

In a source-free region, Maxwell theory of Electromagnetism describes the rules
of energy behaves. in this scenario, electric and magnetic fields can be then
nothing more than ways eletromagnetic energy behaves.

First, consider there are no "sources" or "sinks" of energy -- points from where
enerfy magically appears or disappears.

In this scenario, electric and magnetic fields are "divergence-free":

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0,
\qquad
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0.
$$

Field lines do not begin or end in empty space. This is not a metaphysical
statement; it is an experimental one. Even when measuring the electric
potential, 'ground' (the "sink") has to be established, making the configuration
a closed circulation loop of energy.

Second, electromagnetic energy obeys a single continuity equation, derived
directly from Maxwell’s equations:

$$
\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{S} = 0,
$$

where $u$ is the electromagnetic energy density and

$$
\mathbf{S}
$$

is the Poynting vector.

This equation states that energy cannot be created or destroyed locally. It may
only flow.

No other conservation laws are postulated: momentum conservation, inertia, and
effective forces are consequences of this continuity when energy flow is
geometrically constrained, or allowed to interact.

These two ingredients -divergence-free fields and a single continuity equation—
define the entire framework.


## Energy flow as the primary object

In Maxwell theory, the fundamental dynamical object is not a particle or a wave,
but energy flow.

The Poynting vector

$$
\mathbf{S}
$$

specifies both the direction and rate at which electromagnetic energy moves
through space. Wherever energy exists, it is in motion.

Crucially, nothing in Maxwell theory requires this motion to be straight, open,
or unbounded. Energy flow lines may curve, wrap, interlock, or close on
themselves, provided continuity and divergence-free structure are preserved.

This freedom is rarely explored. Yet it is the source of everything that
follows.


## Effective slowing without stopping light

Light is often said to slow down in materials. The usual explanation appeals to
atoms, electrons, and microscopic absorption processes.

But the phenomenon does not require matter.

Maxwell theory is linear, meaning that fields superpose. Linearity, however,
does not imply non-interaction. Physical observables depend on the total field
configuration, not on individual components.

When electromagnetic fields with different phases overlap, the resulting total
field evolves more slowly in phase than any single component. This requires no
nonlinear correction and no violation of locality. It is a direct consequence of
superposition applied to phase-shifted fields.

Energy propagates continuously, but the different fields components superimpose
and interfere, resulting in an effective lag due to the overlap of delayed
components. The result is an effective reduction in propagation speed that
depends only on electromagnetic energy density.

Light does not slow by waiting. It slows because its evolution is distributed
across overlapping field contributions.


## Geometry as a source of inertia

There is a second, independent way to reduce effective motion.

Electromagnetic energy always propagates locally at the speed allowed by the
local field configuration. Maxwell theory does not permit energy to pause.

However, nothing requires energy to propagate in straight lines.

If energy flow follows a curved or looping path, it must travel a longer
distance to achieve the same forward displacement. Local speed is unchanged, but
forward progress per unit time is reduced.

This is a purely geometric effect.

Motion is not the same as displacement. Pure circulation involves motion without
translation.


## Momentum and its decomposition

Electromagnetic energy carries momentum along its direction of flow. When flow
lines curve or loop, momentum decomposes naturally into two components:

- a translational component, associated with net displacement,
- a circulating component, associated with closed motion.

Only the translational component contributes to forward motion. The circulating
component does not disappear. It remains dynamically active but kinematically
trapped.

This trapped momentum resists changes in the translational state of the system.
That resistance is inertia.

Mass is not an additional substance. It is a measure of how much electromagnetic
momentum is locked into circulation rather than translation.

An object's rest frame emerges automatically: a frame in which translational
momentum vanishes while internal circulation persists. No postulate of inertial
frames is required.


## Topology and stability

Why do circulating configurations persist instead of unwinding?

The answer is topological.

Divergence-free energy flow in three dimensions cannot arbitrarily begin or end.
It organizes into tubes, shells, and closed surfaces. The simplest closed
surfaces admitting stable circulation are toroidal shells.

Once circulation is organized on such a surface, it is characterized by integer
winding numbers. These integers cannot change continuously. Eliminating
circulation would require a discontinuous reconnection of field structure.

Stability is therefore not imposed. It is enforced by continuity and topology.


## Strings, membranes, and dimensionality

In this framework, nothing fundamental lives on a line or a surface.

Electromagnetic energy occupies volume. Its organization may be described using
lower-dimensional language when transverse degrees of freedom are integrated
out.

Toroidal shells are extended, membrane-like energy-supporting structures. When
their thickness is averaged over, or when characteristic flow lines are
followed, they admit effective one-dimensional descriptions.

These descriptions are strings.

Strings are not fundamental objects here. They are summaries of structured
electromagnetic membranes. Membranes themselves are summaries of volumetric
energy flow.

Dimensionality is descriptive, not ontological.


## No contradiction, only mechanisms

It may appear contradictory to say that light both slows down and never slows
down.

There is no contradiction.

Effective motion can be reduced in two independent ways:

- temporal reconstruction through overlap of phase-shifted fields,
- geometric redistribution through curved or looping paths.

In both cases, local propagation rules are respected. No signal outruns its
local limit. Continuity is preserved.

Forward motion changes because timing or direction changes, not because light
stops.


## What this closes, and what it does not

This framework does not claim to predict every numerical detail of nature. It
does not enumerate particles or spectra.

What it closes is the set of postulates - none are required.

Source-free Maxwell theory already forms a closed dynamical system from which
mass, inertia, confinement, effective refraction, and string- or membrane-like
structure follow naturally.

Nothing additional is required.


## Closing statement

Reality is not made of particles, strings, membranes, or volumes. It is made of
continuous electromagnetic energy flow in three dimensions, constrained by
divergence-free field structure and a single continuity equation.

Everything else is description.
