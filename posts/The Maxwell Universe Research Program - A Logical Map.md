one-sentence-summary: A complete logical map of the Maxwell Universe Research Program, organizing its output documents by sections, claims, dependencies, and production status.
summary: This document provides a systematic, section-by-section map of the Maxwell Universe Research Program. Each output document is identified by its title and production status (published with DOI or in preparation). For every major section, we list its key claims, logical dependencies, consequences for later documents, and current status. The purpose is to preserve conceptual continuity, make dependencies explicit, and provide a stable reference point for extension and critique.

This document serves as a **conceptual checkpoint** for the Maxwell Universe
Research Program.

It does not introduce new results. It does not reinterpret existing ones.

Its sole purpose is to **preserve structure**: to record what has been
established, how results depend on one another, and where the program remains
open.

The map is organized **by document**, and within each document **by section**.
For each section we record:

- the key claim,
- its logical dependencies,
- what it enables downstream,
- its production status.

## Geometric Inertia: Mass as Trapped Energy

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18249230


### Program role

Derives inertial mass from geometry and circulation alone.

## Defining Electromagnetic Fields from Continuity and Divergence-Free Structure

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18269184


### Program role

Clarifies how vector fields arise from scalar energy descriptions without adding
new primitives.


### Scalar configurations and spatial flow

**Key claim** A single scalar configuration by itself does not define flow; flow
is defined by the spatial relation between scalar configurations under
continuity.

**Depends on**
- Continuity equation

**Enables**

**Enables**
- Toroidal shells
- Circulating energy structures

**Status** Resolved.


### Representation versus dynamics

**Key claim** $(u,\mathbf{S})$ represent energy content and flow;
$(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$ are one possible encoding. Dynamics must not be
conflated with representation.

**Depends on**

## The Maxwell Universe Research Program

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18274175


### Program role

Defines stance, scope, and boundaries of the program.


### Key clarifications

- Source-free does not deny localized structures.
- Charges and currents are configurations, not primitives.
- Stability arises from topology, not forces.
- Minimal does not mean unique or final.

**Status** Resolved.


## Global program status

### Fully established

- Refraction without matter
- Mass without particles
- Stability without forces (stability arising from circulation and topology
  rather than force balance)
- String- and membrane-like structure as effective descriptions
- Maxwell dynamics as minimal divergence-preserving evolution
- Vector fields arising from scalar relations under continuity


## Closing note

This map is a **stability surface**.

It preserves what is logically forced, records what remains open, and prevents
regression.

Nothing here is speculative. Nothing here is implicit.

Everything else in a Maxwell Universe builds from this.
