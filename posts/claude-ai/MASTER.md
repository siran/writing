## Foundational Chain (The Derivation)

### Level 0: Ontology
- **Primitive:** Energy exists (u ≥ 0)
- **Observation:** Energy is observed at different times
- **Necessity:** Two snapshots u(x,t₁) and u(x,t₂)

### Level 1: Continuity Forces Flux
- Change between snapshots requires explanation
- ∂ₜu alone doesn't specify how energy moves
- **Forced:** Vector flux S from continuity equation
- **Result:** ∂ₜu + ∇·S = 0

### Level 2: Source-Free Constraint
- **Empirical:** No point creation/destruction of energy
- **Constraint:** ∇·S = 0 (divergence-free)

### Level 3: Dynamics Must Preserve Structure
- Need evolution rule: ∂ₜF = D(F)
- Gradient fails: ∂ₜF = ∇φ → ∂ₜ(∇·F) = ∇²φ ≠ 0
- **Curl succeeds:** ∂ₜF = ∇×G → ∂ₜ(∇·F) = 0 identically
- **Result:** Maxwell as minimal description of curl-based flow

### Level 4: Field Reconstruction
- Given (u, S) with |S| ≤ cu
- Can construct (E, B) such that:
  - u = (ε₀/2)|E|² + (1/2μ₀)|B|²
  - S = (1/μ₀)E × B
- **Non-unique:** 2 degrees of freedom (polarization)
- **Interpretation:** E and B are minimal orthogonal decomposition of flow in 3D

### Level 5: There is Only Flow
- Not "two fields E and B"
- One flow, minimally decomposed
- Helical/rotating energy transport
- E, B = names for rotational aspects of same flow

### Level 6: Topology Forces Discreteness
- Closed flow paths on torus T²
- Integer windings (m,n) forced by topology
- Discrete modes from geometry
- **No quantization axiom needed**

### Level 7: Quantum Mechanics Emerges
- Narrow-band approximation of Maxwell wave equation
- Schrödinger equation with O(ε²) error term
- ℏ = E₁₁/ω₁₁ (geometric property of fundamental mode)
- m = E₁₁/c² (trapped energy)
- **QM is approximation to Maxwell dynamics**

### Level 8: Particles Don't Exist
- Stable localized flow patterns = "particles"
- Knot topology → particle spectrum
- Mass = trapped energy
- Charge = topological property of knot
- **Everything is organized flow**

## Key Insights

### Measurement Without Mystery
- Apparatus is electromagnetic structure
- Adding apparatus = adding field structure to existing field
- Total field reorganizes
- "Collapse" = conditioning on observation channel
- **No separate measurement postulate needed**

### Entanglement is Pseudo-Problem
- "Two particles" = two peaks in one continuous field
- Field was never separate
- "Entanglement" = noticing field is continuous
- Bell violations = field is not hidden-variable particles
- **Problem dissolves with field ontology**

### Tunneling is Not Tunneling
- Field configuration exists everywhere
- Barrier = new field structure added
- Field was already in "forbidden" region
- **Not crossing barrier - was already there**

### Boundaries are Permeable
- Boundary made of electromagnetic energy
- Can't use field to isolate field from field
- Multipole configurations span "barriers"
- **Every containment is field reorganization**

### No True Isolation
- Observer, apparatus, system = same continuous field
- Experiment = field examining itself
- Measurement = local reorganization
- **No outside observer possible**

## Pedagogical Approach

- **Prerequisites:** None (teach from scratch)
- **Mathematical level:** Graduate rigor, taught as needed
- **Introduce math from physics:** Each concept motivated by physical necessity
- **No particle language ever:** Field ontology from page 1
- **No "shut up and calculate":** Every step physically motivated
- **No paradoxes:** Show they never existed

---

## Open Questions

1. Complete knot classification → particle spectrum?
2. Gauge symmetries from topology?
3. Specific testable predictions where QM approximation fails?
4. Numerical simulation of stable EM knots?

## Notes for Authors

- Keep language precise but accessible
- Every "force" or "particle" must be in quotes or avoided
- Emphasize: we're describing what IS, not legislating what must be
- Mathematics is descriptive, not prescriptive
- Energy flow is the reality; equations describe it
- Maxwell is not "dynamics" - it's our description of how flow behaves

## Conversation Log

### 2026-02-14: Initial conception
- Established foundational chain
- Clarified: scalar u is primitive, S forced by continuity, (E,B) are representation
- Recognized: one flow, minimal decomposition (not "two fields")
- Understanding: there is no "vector field F" - only scalar u(x,t) and its evolution
- Agreed: title "The Physics of Energy Flow"
- Decided: from scratch, graduate rigor, assume nothing
- Insight: boundaries are permeable (multipole configurations exist on both sides)
- Insight: no true isolation possible (barrier and system are same substance)
- Created: this master document for context persistence
