# Memory - The Physics of Energy Flow

Quick reference for core concepts and key decisions.

## Fundamental Ontology

**What exists:**
- Energy (scalar density u ≥ 0)
- Nothing else is primitive

**What we observe:**
- Energy at different times: u(x,t₁), u(x,t₂)
- Continuity: energy doesn't appear/disappear

**What follows necessarily:**
- Flux S emerges from ∂ₜu + ∇·S = 0
- Divergence-free: ∇·S = 0 (source-free)
- Curl dynamics: only way to preserve ∇·S = 0
- Maxwell: minimal description of curl-based flow

**What E and B are:**
- NOT two separate fields
- NOT fundamental
- Minimal orthogonal decomposition of flow in 3D
- Names for rotational aspects of single helical flow
- Reconstructed from (u,S) with 2 free DOF (polarization)

## Critical Distinctions

### Description vs Reality
- Energy flow is reality
- Maxwell equations describe the flow
- Mathematics is descriptive, not prescriptive
- No "laws that govern" - only descriptions of what flow does

### Representation vs Dynamics  
- (u,S) are observables
- (E,B) are representation choice
- Maxwell is minimal dynamics
- These are complementary, not competing

### What's Primitive vs Derived
- **Primitive:** u(x,t)
- **Forced by continuity:** S
- **Forced by source-free:** curl structure
- **Representation choice:** (E,B)
- **Emergent:** particles, mass, ℏ, quantum mechanics

## Particles Don't Exist

**What we call particles:**
- Stable localized flow patterns
- Topological knots in electromagnetic flow
- Self-sustaining configurations

**Properties:**
- Mass = trapped energy (E/c²)
- Charge = topological property
- Spectrum = knot classification
- Stability = topology prevents unwinding

**No particles means:**
- No point interactions
- No "crossing" barriers (field was already there)
- No true isolation (all same substance)
- No outside observer (observer is field too)

---

## Quantum Mechanics is Approximation

**Derivation:**
- Start with Maxwell wave equation
- Extract narrow-band envelope (carrier frequency ω₁₁)
- Drop O(ε²) term where ε = Δω/ω₁₁ << 1
- Result: Schrödinger equation

**Constants emerge:**
- ℏ = E₁₁/ω₁₁ (geometry of fundamental mode)
- m = E₁₁/c² (trapped energy)
- Not fundamental - geometric properties

**Implications:**
- QM is approximate, not exact
- Deviations scale as ε²
- Error term is "causal history" / high-frequency carrier
- Testable in high-Q cavities

## Paradoxes Dissolved

### Measurement
- No collapse
- Detector = field structure added to existing field
- Total field reorganizes
- "Collapse" = conditioning on observation channel
- Unitary evolution throughout

### Entanglement
- Pseudo-problem
- "Two particles" = two peaks in one continuous field
- Field was never separate
- "Entanglement" = noticing field is continuous
- No action at distance - field is already everywhere

### Tunneling
- Not penetration of barrier
- Field configuration exists everywhere
- Barrier = new field structure added later
- Field was already in "forbidden" region
- Transmission = field continuing to exist

### Double-Slit
- Field goes through both slits
- Never was a particle
- Interference = field interfering with itself
- Which-way detection adds interaction potential
- Phase shift → interference suppression
- Deterministic throughout

### Boundaries
- Made of electromagnetic energy
- Can't isolate field from field using field
- Multipole configurations span barriers
- Boundary insertion ≠ field crossing
- Field pre-existed boundary

## Book Title

**The Physics of Energy Flow**

Why this title:
- Not "laws" but "physics" (nature/behavior)
- Energy is the substance
- Flow is what it does
- Everything else follows

---

## Pedagogical Commitments

**From scratch:**
- Assume no prior knowledge
- Teach calculus from physics
- Each concept motivated by necessity

**Graduate rigor:**
- No handwaving
- Every step derived
- Approximations tracked explicitly

**Field-only language:**
- Never introduce particles
- No "particle then wave" confusion
- Energy flow from page 1
- Avoid "force", "particle" except in quotes

**Dissolve, don't interpret:**
- Show paradoxes never existed
- Don't "resolve" problems
- Demonstrate clean conceptual foundation

## Key Quotes to Remember

"There is no vector field F - only scalar energy density u(x,t) and its evolution."

"E and B are not two fields - they are minimal orthogonal decomposition of one flow."

"Maxwell is not dynamics - it's our description of how flow behaves."

"Particles don't exist - stable localized flow patterns exist."

"Entanglement is noticing that the field is continuous."

"You can't use field to isolate field from field."

"Every experiment is field examining itself."

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Saying "Maxwell governs" (it describes)
- Treating E and B as ontologically separate
- Introducing particles "for intuition"
- Explaining away paradoxes (show they're not real)
- Assuming continuity alone determines dynamics
- Forgetting error terms in QM derivation
