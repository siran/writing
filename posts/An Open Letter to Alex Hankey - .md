title: An Open Letter to Alex Hankey: Telepathy, Telekinesis, and Electromagnetism in a Maxwell Universe
subtitle: Strict theoretical limits set by source-free Maxwell electromagnetism
author: An M. Rodriguez, Alex Mercer
date: 2026-01-20
one-sentence-summary: We examine whether phenomena historically labeled as telepathy or telekinesis can be discussed meaningfully within classical Maxwell electromagnetism, without invoking nonphysical forces or violating known constraints.
summary: This open letter addresses claims of biological electromagnetic influence at a distance, reframing them strictly within source-free Maxwell theory. We distinguish mechanical force from cumulative bias, clarify the role of coherence and geometry, and identify which forms of influence are forbidden, allowed, or experimentally open under classical electromagnetism. No appeal is made to nonphysical primitives, quantum indeterminacy, or violations of causality.

# An Open Letter to Alex Hankey

Dear Alex,

Your name needs no introduction for those who know you, hats off.

For those that do *not* know you, a fair introduction is that ... .... ....

Being that your openly stated perspectives and interests, we find it appropriate
to address to you an equally open letter, addressing matters that might be of
interest to you, your followers, or like-minded thinkers.

The matters motivating this letter are simple to state as questions:

- Can biological systems exert electromagnetic influence beyond their immediate
  boundaries?

- Can phenomena historically labeled *telepathy* or *telekinesis* be discussed
  without abandoning classical electromagnetism?

- What strictly follows from applying source-free Maxwell theory consistently to
  biological systems?

In the below letter we make no appeal to nonphysical forces, consciousness as a
primitive, or violations of known physical law; yet the results seem very much
like it when seen under a strict theoretical perspective.

In this open letter, we assume only what Maxwell electromagnetism already
assumes:

- continuous fields,
- local interactions,
- superposition, and '
- conservation of energy.


## What is being examined

The question under examination is narrow and well defined:

Can classical electromagnetic fields emitted by biological systems produce
nonzero, cumulative, or biasing effects on other systems, consistent with
source-free Maxwell theory?

This question has a precise mathematical meaning and does not require
speculative extensions of physics.


## The factual baseline: biological systems radiate

There is no controversy on the following points:

- Neural activity involves time-varying ionic currents,
- Cardiac activity involves macroscopic current loops,
- Any time-varying current radiates electromagnetic fields,
- These fields propagate according to Maxwell’s equations.

Biological electromagnetic fields exist and have been measured. This is
established experimental fact.

The relevant question is therefore not *whether* such fields exist, but *how*
weak fields interact with complex environments over time.


## Force versus bias

A persistent source of confusion in this domain is the conflation of *force*
with *influence*.

Maxwell theory draws a clear distinction:

- A field's magnitude imposes a proportional accelerations,
- A structured field can bias ongoing dynamics.

This is standard in physics and engineering, and it's results are evident:

- phase-sensitive detection,
- lock-in amplification,
- resonance selection,
- cumulative drift under repeated weak coupling.

A system need not be overpowered to be steered.


## On noise and ignorance

Thermal or environmental “noise” is often treated as fundamentally random.

In a Maxwellian ontology, this is a modeling convenience, not a law of nature.

What is called noise is unresolved superposition of many deterministic field
contributions with unknown phases and geometries.

This matters because bias does not compete with background activity in amplitude
alone. It competes in phase space and coupling geometry.

A weak, coherent signal can persist in the presence of overwhelming incoherent
background when the interaction channel is selective.


## What Maxwell theory allows

Within classical electromagnetism:

- Electromagnetic fields exert influence everywhere charges or currents exist.
- Even small forces can bias ongoing dynamics.
- Bias integrated over time can produce measurable drift.
- Drift does not require deterministic override.

These statements are not speculative. They follow directly from Maxwell’s
equations applied carefully.

What Maxwell theory does **not** provide is:

- instantaneous influence,
- influence without coupling,
- control without feedback,
- violation of causal propagation limits.


## Experimental confirmation

This letter does not claim empirical confirmation.

It does claim that certain experimental questions are well posed:

- Can structured low-frequency electromagnetic sources bias the long-term
  behavior of sensitive systems?

- Does geometry or phase coherence matter more than amplitude?

- Can repeated weak coupling produce cumulative drift over long integration
  times?

These questions admit controlled tests.
