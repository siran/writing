one-sentence-summary: Causality emerges in the PNP framework because a topologically non-trivial scalar field configuration cannot remain static without violating stress–energy conservation, forcing ordered temporal evolution.
summary: "We derive causality from first principles within the Point–Not–Point (PNP) framework. At its core lies the topological irreducibility of the fundamental $\nu=1$ mode: the simplest closed oscillation of a scalar field $U$ exhibiting a $\pi$ phase inversion. This $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant enforces loop persistence and forbids extinction without a phase slip. From this, we prove that such a mode cannot remain static, formalizing cause–effect not as a postulate, but as the inevitable action of the field propagator on a persistent topological sector. We further extend this result to suggest that stress gradients in the conserved flow induce gravitation-like dynamics for configurations whose energy density exhibits vortex-like decay."

## 1. Introduction

In standard formulations of physics, causality is assumed as a primitive
ordering of events —time exists, and things move through it. In the
Point–Not–Point (PNP) framework, we invert this relationship. We propose that
causality emerges from **Topology**: specifically, from the requirement that a
non-trivial field configuration must evolve to maintain its structural
integrity.

We show that a minimally nontrivial loop of the scalar field $U$
(the fundamental "Entity") persists under evolution. We prove that such a mode
cannot remain static without violating local momentum conservation. Time here is
not assumed as a background ordering, but emerges as the parameter labeling
successive configurations required to preserve topology. Thus, cause–effect is
the temporal manifestation of topological persistence.


## 2. The PNP Framework and the Fundamental Mode

Let $U: \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a real scalar energy field. We define the
complex envelope $A(\mathbf{x},t)$ as a local phase–amplitude decomposition of
the oscillatory solutions of $U$:

$$
A(\mathbf{x},t) = \rho(\mathbf{x},t)\,e^{i\phi(\mathbf{x},t)}, \qquad \rho \ge 0, \ \phi \in \mathbb{R} \pmod{2\pi}
$$

*Note: The complex envelope $A$ is a bookkeeping device for local
oscillatory structure in a real scalar field; no additional $U(1)$
degrees of freedom are introduced.*


### 2.1 The Topological Invariant

We define a **(1) Mode** as a closed loop $C$ encircling a core
such that one traversal advances the phase $\phi$ by $\pi$
(a Möbius-like twist). This requires two traversals to return to the initial
state.

The holonomy along $C$ is:

$$
H(C) = \exp\!\left(i\oint_C \nabla\phi \cdot d\mathbf{l}\right) \in \{+1, -1\}
$$

This defines the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index $\nu$:

$$
\nu = \frac{1 - H(C)}{2} \in \{0, 1\}
$$

* $\nu=0$: Trivial topology (Phase advances by $2\pi$ or
  $0$).
* $\nu=1$: Non-trivial topology (Phase advances by $\pi$).

Crucially, $\nu$ is a topological invariant. It cannot change
continuously; it can only change via a **Phase Slip** (where $\rho \to 0$ at
a point on $C$), effectively breaking the loop.


## 3. Field Dynamics and Stress–Energy

The source-free PNP equation of motion is given by the vanishing of the exterior
derivative of the dual:

$$
d(\star dU) = 0
$$

With a Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}(U, \nabla U)$, the stress–energy tensor
is:

$$
T_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_\mu U\,\nabla_\nu U - g_{\mu\nu}\,\mathcal{L}, \qquad \nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0
$$

*Note: No specific form of $\mathcal{L}$ is required for this argument beyond
locality, positivity of energy density, and the existence of a conserved
stress–energy tensor.*

We define the Energy Density ($u$) and Flux ($J^\mu$)
relative to a local time vector $t^\nu$:

$$
u = T^{00}, \qquad J^\mu = T^\mu{}_\nu\,t^\nu
$$


## 4. Derivation of Causality

We now prove that "Time" is a requirement for the existence of the
$\nu=1$ mode.


### 4.1 Sector Decomposition

The configuration space decomposes into disjoint sectors labeled by
$\nu$. The evolution generated by $d(\star dU)=0$ preserves sector
labels except at singularities (Phase Slips). Therefore, a persistent entity
satisfies:

$$
\nu(t+\Delta t) = \nu(t) = 1
$$


### 4.2 Persistence Forbids Stasis (The Proof)

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the field is static:
$\Phi(t+\Delta t) = \Phi(t)$ for all $t$. This implies
$\partial_t U = 0$ everywhere on the loop, which means the momentum flux density
(energy flow) $T^{0i}$ must vanish.

However, for a loop with $\pi$-twist topology ($\nu=1$), the
phase gradient $\nabla \phi$ is non-zero and twisted. This implies nonzero
spatial stress components ($T^{ij} \neq 0$). A static configuration with
non-zero internal stress requires external support to maintain force balance
($\partial_j T^{ij} \neq 0$ without flow).

In a source-free vacuum, no such external force exists. Therefore, a static
$\nu=1$ mode violates local momentum balance. **Topology alone does not
generate motion; rather, the incompatibility between nontrivial topology and
static force balance in a source-free field enforces evolution.**

**Conclusion:** To maintain $\nu=1$ (Persistence), the field **cannot
be static**.

$$
\Phi(t+\Delta t) \neq \Phi(t)
$$

Unlike conventional instabilities which depend on parameters, the
$\nu=1$ instability is topologically protected.


### 4.3 Propagator Form of Cause–Effect

Let $\mathcal{P}_{\Delta t}$ be the evolution operator. On the $\nu=1$
sector:

$$
\Phi(t+\Delta t) = \mathcal{P}_{\Delta t}\,\Phi(t)
$$

"Cause" is the state $\Phi(t)$. "Effect" is the state $\Phi(t+\Delta t)$.
The link between them is not an axiom, but the **Propagator of Topological
Persistence**. The effect is simply the next necessary configuration to prevent
the loop from breaking.


## 5. Force from Stress–Flow

We can extend this to interactions. From $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$ in a
stationary, spherically symmetric flow:

$$
\partial_r T^{rr} + \frac{2}{r}\big(T^{rr} - T^{\theta}{}_{\theta}\big) = 0
$$

For tangentially dominated energy transport (a spinning torus),
$T^{rr} \approx -u(r)$. The induced radial acceleration on test configurations
is:

$$
a_r(r) \propto -\partial_r T^{rr}(r) \approx \partial_r u(r)
$$

For configurations whose energy density exhibits vortex-like decay
($u(r) \sim 1/r$), this yields $a_r \sim -1/r^2$. Thus, this framework suggests
a gravitation-like interaction arising from the **Organization of Energy Flow**,
without the need to postulate intrinsic mass.


## 6. Conclusion

In the PNP framework, we do not need to postulate that "Time Flows" or "Gravity
Attracts."

1.  **Causality** is the result of **Topological Persistence** ($\nu=1$
    implies $\partial_t \Phi \neq 0$).
2.  **Force** is the result of **Stress-Energy Conservation**
    ($\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0$).

Reality is a self-driving machine: it moves because it is topologically
forbidden from standing still.
