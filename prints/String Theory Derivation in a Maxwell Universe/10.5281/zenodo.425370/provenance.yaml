one_sentence_summary: When electromagnetic energy flow organizes on invariant tori, classical Maxwell theory produces integer winding numbers, tension, inertia, and discrete mode spectra stabilized by energy-dependent effective refraction.
abstract: We show how linear, classical Maxwell theory admits toroidally organized energy flow whose closed trajectories are labeled by integer winding numbers. Localized electromagnetic energy flow defines an effective one-dimensional object with tension and inertia computed directly from field densities. Stability against dispersion arises because high electromagnetic energy density reduces the local effective speed of light, producing self-trapping through emergent refraction. Explicit null Maxwell solutions with torus-knot topology demonstrate that integer data (m,n) are computable from conserved field integrals. String-theoretic structures thus emerge as effective descriptions of self-stabilizing electromagnetic topology.
