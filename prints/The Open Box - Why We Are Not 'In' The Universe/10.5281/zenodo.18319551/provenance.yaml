one_sentence_summary: We argue that the concept of a spatial container is an optical illusion, proposing instead that reality is a self-referential field topology where "objects" are knots and "time" is the metabolic cost of their persistence.
abstract: We challenge the fundamental assumption that space is a container and matter exists "inside" it. Using the Point–Not–Point (PNP) framework, we demonstrate that "objects" are actually self-confined topological knots in a scalar field. We show that the distinction between "in" and "out" is a phase relationship ($0$ vs $\pi$), not a spatial boundary, and that time is not a background dimension but the byproduct of the field's persistence.
