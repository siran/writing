This document serves as a **conceptual checkpoint** for the Maxwell Universe
Research Program.

It does not introduce new results. It does not reinterpret existing ones.

Its sole purpose is to **preserve structure**: to record what has been
established, how results depend on one another, and where the program remains
open.

The map is organized **by document**, and within each document **by section**.
For each section we record:

- the key claim,
- its logical dependencies,
- what it enables downstream,
- its production status.


## Light Speed as an Emergent Property of Electromagnetic Superposition

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18209801


### Program role

Establishes that effective propagation speed is not a primitive constant, but an
emergent property of electromagnetic superposition.

**Key claim** Maxwell’s equations are linear, but physical observables are
quadratic. Linearity does not imply non-interaction.

- Emergent refractive behavior

**Status** Resolved.


### Quadratic observables and phase delay

**Key claim** Overlapping electromagnetic fields with different phases produce a
total field whose evolution is slower than any individual component.

### Program role

Shows how closed electromagnetic energy flow produces string- and membrane-like
structure without introducing new objects.


### Energy transport in Maxwell theory

**Key claim** Energy transport is intrinsic to Maxwell theory through the
Poynting vector.

- Poynting theorem

**Enables**
- Definition of flow velocity
- Flow-first ontology

**Status** Resolved.


### Toroidal organization and winding numbers

**Key claim** Closed divergence-free flows on a torus enforce integer winding
numbers $(m,n)$.

**Depends on**
- Topology of the torus
- Divergence-free tangent flows

**Enables**
- Discrete global classification
- Topological stability

**Status** Resolved.

**Status** Resolved.


### Stability and discrete excitation spectrum

**Key claim** Self-induced refraction and periodicity produce stable, discrete
modes.

- Particle-like persistence
- Quantized excitations

**Status** Resolved.


## Geometric Inertia: Mass as Trapped Energy

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18249230


### Program role

Derives inertial mass from geometry and circulation alone.


### Geometry of constrained motion

**Key claim** Local propagation at the maximal rate combined with curved paths
produces reduced effective translation.

**Depends on**
- Euclidean geometry
- Path length versus displacement

**Enables**
- Subluminal effective motion without slowing local propagation

**Status** Resolved.


### Momentum decomposition

**Key claim** Momentum splits into translational and circulating components;
only the former contributes to net motion.

**Depends on**
- Momentum density
- Directional decomposition

**Enables**
- Definition of inertial resistance

**Status** Resolved.


### Mass from circulation

**Key claim** Inertial mass measures momentum trapped in circulation.

**Depends on**
- Previous decomposition

**Enables**
- Mass without matter

**Status** Resolved.


### Topological stability

**Key claim** Knotted or wound circulation prevents continuous unwinding,
stabilizing mass (self-sustaining electromagnetic knots.)

**Depends on**
- Topology
- Integer winding

**Enables**
- Persistent objects

**Status** Resolved.


## Defining Electromagnetic Fields from Continuity and Divergence-Free Structure

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18269184


### Program role

Clarifies how vector fields arise from scalar energy descriptions without adding
new primitives.


### Scalar configurations and spatial flow

**Key claim** A single scalar configuration by itself does not define flow; flow
is defined by the spatial relation between scalar configurations under
continuity.

**Depends on**
- Continuity equation

**Enables**
- Necessity of vectorial description

**Status** Resolved.


### Divergence-free structure and circulation

**Key claim** Locally, divergence-free structure implies curl structure and
circulation; globally, topology determines allowed circulation.

**Depends on**
- Vector calculus identities
- Topological conditions

**Enables**
- Toroidal shells
- Circulating energy structures

**Status** Resolved.


### Representation versus dynamics

**Key claim** $(u,\mathbf{S})$ represent energy content and flow;
$(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$ are one possible encoding. Dynamics must not be
conflated with representation.

**Depends on**
- Degree-of-freedom counting

**Enables**
- Avoidance of false derivations

**Status** Resolved.


### Reconstruction lemma

**Key claim** Given $(u,\mathbf{S})$ with $|\mathbf{S}|\le cu$, at least one
pair $(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$ exists reproducing them.

**Depends on**
- Algebraic constraints
- Energy and flux definitions

**Enables**
- Field reconstruction
- Interpretation of polarization

**Status** Resolved.


## Maxwell Electromagnetism as the Minimal Dynamics of Divergence-Free Energy Flow

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18264435


### Program role

Explains why Maxwell’s equations appear as the minimal evolution law compatible
with divergence-free transport.


### Continuity as kinematic

**Key claim** Continuity constrains accounting, not motion.

**Depends on**
- Definition of continuity

**Enables**
- Need for a dynamical closure

**Status** Resolved.


### Failure of gradient-driven dynamics

**Key claim** Gradient-driven evolution generically creates divergence and
cannot describe source-free transport.

**Depends on**

**Enables**
- Exclusion of algebraic-only evolution

**Status** Resolved.


### Curl as minimal divergence-preserving operator

DOI: https://writing.preferredframe.com/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18274175


### Program role

Defines stance, scope, and boundaries of the program.


### Key clarifications

- Source-free does not deny localized structures.
- Charges and currents are configurations, not primitives.
- Stability arises from topology, not forces.
- Minimal does not mean unique or final.

**Status** Resolved.


## Global program status


### Fully established

- Refraction without matter
- Mass without particles
- Stability without forces (stability arising from circulation and topology
  rather than force balance)
- String- and membrane-like structure as effective descriptions
- Maxwell dynamics as minimal divergence-preserving evolution
- Vector fields arising from scalar relations under continuity


## Closing note

This map is a **stability surface**.

It preserves what is logically forced, records what remains open, and prevents
regression.

Nothing here is speculative. Nothing here is implicit.

Everything else in a Maxwell Universe builds from this.
