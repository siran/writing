<h1 id="part-i-foundations-of-reality">PART I — FOUNDATIONS OF REALITY
<span id="part-i-foundations-of-reality"></span></h1>
<p>Part I develops a framework in which events are the starting point. A
registered change creates the basic distinction between “before” and
“after.” Systems that update their state in response to influences build
internal orderings, and from these orderings time emerges.</p>
<p>Causal steps link events into chains, and then loops. Loops support
recurrent patterns and can act as clocks. Counting causal steps gives
duration and also distance: the minimal number of steps between two
events. Collecting all pairwise distances produces an effective
geometry.</p>
<p>Space and dimension arise when these distances can be embedded with
low distortion into a space of some dimension. Multiple embeddings imply
non-unique dimension; failure of all embeddings implies that geometry
does not apply. Space and dimension are therefore relational constructs,
not fundamental ingredients of reality.</p>
<p>The same compression mechanism explains arithmetic and mathematical
laws. Stable patterns become symbolic rules; when the patterns shift,
the rules shift with them. Mathematics succeeds where reality presents
regularities, and fails where it does not.</p>
<p>Across Part I, a single theme recurs: we do not access the underlying
causal structure itself. We access only its effects, and from these we
construct representations that remain valid only while the observed
patterns stay stable.</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="1-from-darkness-light">1. From Darkness,
Light</h1>
<p>Reality begins not with space or time, but with the simple fact that
events happen.</p>
<p>We often assume events happen for a reason. This doesn’t need to be
so, and even if it is, we don’t have direct access to the causal
information, but indirect through its effects.</p>
<p>A reason is a story added later. What matters is simply that a change
occurs and that it is registered in a way that affects what follows.
Once a change is registered, the system occupies a different state. The
distinction between “before” and “after” is not added to the event; it
is the event.</p>
<p>There is no need to appeal to an intelligence recording what
happened, but only to a persistent state change —like a scratch on a
table— that constrains future interactions. The scratch is not a record
of the event. The scratch is the event, insofar as it makes a
difference.</p>
<p>The sense of reason or explanation arises only as a reactive story, a
way of organizing transitions once change has been noticed by a
reasoning entity (a topic addressed later in <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>).</p>
<p>This reactivity is not limited to conscious minds. Anything that
changes in response to causes and produces effects is, in this minimal
sense, <strong>operationally aware</strong> <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. A
self-sustaining causal loop qualifies: it can update its own state in
response to incoming influences. By doing so, it distinguishes states
and tracks transitions—not through any “plan of action,” which would
imply a consciousness we have not yet defined, but simply by virtue of
its continued existence as a loop. In this minimal operational sense, a
self-sustaining causal loop “notices” change.</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="2-time">2. Time</h1>
<p>Time is, thus, a construct: a tool operational awareness uses to
organize its state. Each loop forms its own internal notion of time. Yet
we maintain collective agreements: certain event-patterns (“causes”)
tend to precede others (“effects”). Those who do not share the
prevailing interpretation are often labeled “irrational,” though this
only reflects different mappings between change and order.</p>
<p>We may picture “reality” <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> as a Node with an
unknowable internal structure <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. All we know is that
this structure reproduces patterns of transitions from which we infer
“before” and “after.”</p>
<p>What we call “the past” is reconstructed <em>now</em>, from present
evidence. If new evidence appears, our reconstruction may shift. The
long debate about whether dietary fat was harmful or beneficial is a
familiar example later shown to rest on selective data <a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.
Consensus reality is fragile. Without external anchors, interpretations
feel arbitrary, raising the persistent question: what is real?</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="3-orderings">3. Orderings</h1>
<p>From the primitive relation</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>n</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> ≻ <em>n</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>,</span></p>
<p>meaning “<span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> causes <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span>,” an ordering
arises: before and after. We may call this succession of events <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> a <strong>causal
step</strong>.</p>
<p>A series of events forms a <strong>causal chain</strong>: i <span
class="math inline">→</span> a <span class="math inline">→</span> b
<span class="math inline">→</span> c <span class="math inline">→</span>
d <span class="math inline">→</span> j.</p>
<p>Chains can form loops:</p>
<p>… <span class="math inline">→</span> j <span
class="math inline">→</span> i <span class="math inline">→</span> a
<span class="math inline">→</span> b <span class="math inline">→</span>
c <span class="math inline">→</span> j <span
class="math inline">→</span> i <span class="math inline">→</span> …</p>
<p>and may cross themselves without restriction. Learning is a good
illustration of multiple acknowledgdments and thus multiple “closes”. A
loop can be considered “closed” when its pattern stabilizes in some
useful sense. A “closed” loop, has however to continue propagating, as
we mention later.</p>
<p>Repeated causal loops can function as clocks. Any recurrent sequence
can serve as a clock. Accuracy varies, but recurrence suffices.</p>
<p>Note that an effect that produces no further causes marks the end of
a causal chain. Such an endpoint cannot be registered—there is no return
influence. Therefore the fact that anything is noticed at all implies
that the noticer is, in essence, a self-sustaining causal loop.</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="4-counting-steps">4. Counting Steps</h1>
<p>By counting loops or causal steps, operational awareness defines
durations. Time is an emergent count, not an external parameter.</p>
<p>Distance arises by tracking how many causal steps connect two events.
If a signal travels from event <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> to event <span
class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> through a minimal chain of length
<span
class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span>,
then</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>d</em>(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) ∝ <em>L</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub>.</span></p>
<p>If no path exists, the distance is infinite or undefined. If the only
available path returns to the same event, the round-trip count becomes
an effective measure of separation. Distance is not a spatial coordinate
but an operational measure of causal separation.</p>
<p>These causal distances define an effective geometry. Observers
attempt to map them into familiar spaces of some chosen dimension.</p>
<p>More technically, we can think of a map <span
class="math inline">ℳ</span> into a space of dimension <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em></span>, where each event is assigned a
point, and the distances between those points approximate the causal
distances:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">∥ℳ(<em>i</em>) − ℳ(<em>j</em>)∥ ≈ <em>d</em>(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>).</span></p>
<p>When such embeddings succeed with low distortion, observers perceive
the corresponding events as forming a <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em></span>-dimensional structure under <span
class="math inline">ℳ</span>. If multiple embeddings work, dimension is
not unique. If none succeed, all such maps <span
class="math inline">ℳ</span> are defective and geometry is
ill-defined.</p>
<p>Thus, space, time, and dimension are not fundamental; they arise from
how operational awareness compresses relational patterns. Geometry and
distance appear only after repeated causal patterns stabilize into
expectations.</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="5-space">5. Space</h1>
<p>Distance is the count of causal steps between two events. What we
call “space” is the collection of all such distances. By gathering every
pairwise separation into a single structure, operational awareness
attempts to form a coherent geometric representation.</p>
<p>If the full set of causal distances can be embedded with low
distortion into some <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em></span>-dimensional space, we say the
events appear to be <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em></span>-dimensional. If no low-distortion
embedding exists, the notion of dimension breaks down.</p>
<p>The same distance data may admit several embeddings. A configuration
may fit a triangle, two overlapping triangles, a star, or other shapes.
Nothing enforces a unique interpretation; different interpretations may
even coexist and function adequately. We only have effects—the causal
distances—and from them we infer patterns to some acceptable accuracy.
The preferred embedding is usually (but not always) the one that
compresses the relations with minimal complexity while keeping
distortion tolerable. Occam’s razor reflects this preference.</p>
<p>This pattern-recognition mechanism is not limited to geometry.
Arithmetic emerges the same way. Repeated causal acts—placing one apple
in a bag, then another—stabilize into a reliable pattern. From this,
operational awareness forms the abstraction that <span
class="math inline">1 + 1 = 2</span>. If two apples reliably produced
three, arithmetic would encode that instead, and we would again regard
the universe as “mathematical.” The rule is not discovered beneath
reality; it is extracted from consistent effects and then used to
predict further effects.</p>
<p>In some contexts, <span class="math inline">1 + 1</span> can take any
value permitted by the rules. One may define a formal system where <span
class="math inline">1 + 1 = 3</span> and build consistent mathematics
from it. Even in everyday settings, combining two things rarely doubles
a quantity cleanly. The outcome depends on the combination rules:
posture, leverage, strategy. Only once those rules are fixed does the
expression <span class="math inline">1 + 1 = 2</span> become the correct
statement. The “truth” of arithmetic reflects operational assumptions,
not the causal substrate.</p>
<p>Space, time, dimension, and arithmetic arise from the same mechanism:
recognizing regularities in causally connected events and compressing
them into stable, predictive representations.</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="6-plato-and-the-cave">6. Plato and the Cave</h1>
<p>Plato illustrated the limits of our access to reality. We see
shadows, not the real source. Our interpretations are reconstructions
shaped by limited observation. There is no external vantage point from
which the true structure can be viewed.</p>
<p>We do not have direct access, or in other words, can never observe
the underlying causal substrate of reality; we observe only the effects
that reach us.</p>
<p>Any geometry, dimension, or pattern we assign reflects how these
effects can be compressed into a usable representation. A different
observer, or a different sampling of the same causal structure, may
construct a different representation without contradiction.</p>
<p>Shadows in Plato’s cave correspond to the relational patterns we
detect. The “objects” casting those shadows are the underlying causal
relations, which are inaccessible in themselves. We infer their
organization from recurring effects, and when those effects change, our
inferred picture must change with them. No representation we construct
is guaranteed to be unique, complete, consistent, or stable.</p>
<p>This perspective removes the assumption that there is a single,
correct spatial or mathematical description waiting to be uncovered. Our
models are not mirrors of an external geometry; they are operational
tools built from the limited regularities we can register. Like the
prisoners in the cave, we work with projections, not with the structure
that produces them.</p>
<p>What we call “reality” is therefore a reconstruction: a stable
arrangement of inferred patterns that remains useful so long as the
causal effects available to us support it.</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="7-logic-mathematics-and-reality">7. Logic,
Mathematics, and Reality</h1>
<p>Much has been said about reality being “mathematical,” though the
phrase is rarely defined. The arguments above suggest a simpler view: we
ascribe patterns to reality. Sometimes, we genuinely recognize these
patterns, sometimes because we project them and then treat the
projection as real.</p>
<p>Mathematics does not need to govern the world. Even if reality admits
mathematical structure in some sense, mathematics itself is vastly
larger than anything the world could instantiate. Most mathematics has
no physical counterpart at all, that we know of, yet.</p>
<p>More often, we see the world through the mathematics we have
constructed. Mathematics —and therefore physics— describes those aspects
of reality that admit stable, compressible patterns. When a pattern is
regular enough to be anticipated, we encode it symbolically and call the
result a “law.” When the pattern breaks, the law breaks with it.</p>
<p>It is therefore not that reality is mathematical, nor that
mathematics is the “language of nature.” Rather, mathematics is a
modeling tool we apply to the regularities we can isolate and predict.
Wherever reality resists compression into stable patterns, mathematics
simply does not apply.</p>
<p>Mathematics succeeds because we select what it can describe —and
which patterns we attend to— not because nature is made of numbers,
structures, or -the lastest rebranding- “information.”</p>
<p>The same is true of logic. Logic is not a law imposed on reality; it
is an abstraction distilled from stable, repeatable causal behavior.
Classical logic reflects a world in which states are well-separated and
transitions are consistent.</p>
<p>Just as spatial geometry emerges from the compression of causal
distances into low-distortion embeddings (§4–§5), logical structure
emerges from the compression of causal transitions into stable inference
rules.</p>
<p>When causal structures change, the logic extracted from them changes
as well. That modern physics tolerates superposition or incompatible
descriptions does not mean that reality violates logic. It means that
classical logical categories no longer compress the observed causal
patterns.</p>
<p>This work therefore starts neither from logic nor from mathematics,
but from cause and effect. Logic and mathematics enter later, as tools
shaped by the regularities that causal interactions happen to
exhibit.</p>
<h1 class="chapter"
id="appendix-assumptions-and-derived-commitments">Appendix — Assumptions
and Derived Commitments</h1>
<p>This work adopts a minimal ontology. Only the first three assumptions
are primitive. All others follow from them.</p>
<h2 id="a.1-fundamental-assumptions">A.1 Fundamental Assumptions</h2>
<p><strong>A1. Events occur.</strong> There are changes.</p>
<p><strong>A2. Change can be registered.</strong> Some changes persist
as state differences.</p>
<p><strong>A3. Registered change is itself the effect that
follows.</strong> A registered change is a new state, and nothing beyond
this is required.</p>
<p>No space, time, matter, laws, logic, or mathematics are assumed.</p>
<h3 id="derived-commitments">Derived Commitments</h3>
<p>The following are consequences of A1–A3.</p>
<p><strong>A4. Order exists.</strong> If a registered change is a new
state, a distinction between “before” and “after” exists. This defines
causal order.</p>
<p><strong>A5. Time is ordering, not substance.</strong> Time arises
from consistent causal orderings of registered change.</p>
<p><strong>A6. Existence is persistence.</strong> Anything that exists
does so only insofar as it sustains its own state across change.
Endpoints without return effects do not persist and are therefore
unobservable.</p>
<p>Space, distance, geometry, dimension, mathematics, and logic arise as
further compressions of stable patterns in these orderings, as developed
in §§4–7.</p>
<h2 id="a.2-non-assumptions">A.2 Non-Assumptions</h2>
<p>This work does <strong>not</strong> assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Space as a container.</li>
<li>Time as a flowing parameter.</li>
<li>Spacetime as a fundamental structure.</li>
<li>Geometry as primitive.</li>
<li>Dimension as intrinsic.</li>
<li>Matter, mass, particles, fields, forces, or charges as ontically
separate, non-electromagnetic substances or dynamics.</li>
<li>Quantum postulates or probabilistic axioms.</li>
<li>Mathematical objects as ontologically prior.</li>
<li>Observers as fundamental entities.</li>
<li>Consciousness as a primitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>All such notions appear, if at all, only as <strong>emergent
descriptions</strong> derived from stable cause–effect patterns.</p>
<h2 id="a.3-scope-and-limits">A.3 Scope and Limits</h2>
<p>This part makes no claims about the ultimate nature of the causal
substrate. It addresses only what can be inferred from observable
effects and their regularities.</p>
<p>Any representation constructed here remains valid only insofar as the
observed patterns persist. No guarantee of uniqueness, completeness, or
permanence is asserted.</p>
<h2 id="a.4-role-in-the-full-work">A.4 Role in the Full Work</h2>
<p>Part I establishes the ontological ground required for the later
development of a Maxwell-only universe.</p>
<p>Subsequent parts introduce specific dynamics. Nothing in this part
depends on those dynamics, and nothing in later parts modifies the
assumptions listed above.</p>
<h1 class="chapter" id="synopsis">Synopsis</h1>
<p>A Maxwell Universe begins from a single premise: events occur.</p>
<p>Registered change creates order. From cause–effect relations alone
emerge time, distance, space, dimension, mathematics, and physical law.
No spacetime is assumed. No fixed rules are imposed. The underlying
substrate, if any, is never accessed directly—only the regularities in
its effects are observed and compressed into models.</p>
<p>The first part of A Maxwell Universe establishes this foundation. It
prepares the ground for later volumes, where matter, mass, and charge
appear not as fundamental point-entities, but as extended,
self-sustaining electromagnetic configurations governed entirely by
Maxwell dynamics.</p>
