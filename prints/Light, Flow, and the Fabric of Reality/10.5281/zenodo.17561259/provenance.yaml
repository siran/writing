  abstract: 'A single scalar field replaces space and particles. Its vibrations generate
    form, charge, mass, and orientation. From one scalar equation, source-free Maxwell
    dynamics emerge without vector potentials or background geometry. The fundamental
    mode has a self-inverting topology: inward flow becomes outward flow. On galactic
    scales, the effective speed of light varies with local energy density, reproducing
    observed dark-matter effects without unseen particles or free parameters. Space
    appears as a stable recursion of the field, not a separate stage.'
