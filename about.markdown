Hi! I am An Rodriguez and you are visiting the den of my thoughts.

## F.A.Q.

### What Am I?
I am spirit, and so are you.

### What are then body and mind?
We control our minds and body, which are our tools to navigate in this world.

### What is our job?
Our job is to forgive and lay the grounds for love.

### What has An done with his life so far?
The most important thing I've done is by far my daughter.

I am also proud of being a self-learner. I've navigated my waters through fundamental physics, philosophy, literature, non-literature, arts (I like playing music mostly, but also painting or writing), languages, computation and technology.

I am also an immigrant to the United States of America. Not an easy feat (though I didn't have it particularly bad either).

A friend of mine told me recently (he's also self-exiled) that one of the things he had learned, after all these years, was to recognize all that we had left behind and that we didn't consciously know we had but fulfilled us on the inside: friends everywhere, cozy holiday parties with family and a bit etcetera.

Perhaps the second most important thing I've done was so far, was to embark on multiple experimental journeys that I'll be finally writing about.

Any more questions?
