So, while listening to an excellent piece by [Miles Davis - We Want Miles - My Man's Gone Now (Live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Ifp2GB_y0), abstract thoughts come to mind.

## Why write?

*[I write to find out what I am thinking - Joan Didion](https://siran.github.io/assets/writing/i-write-to-find-out-what-i-am-thinking---joan-didion.png)*


I agree with Joan in that I also write to find out what I'm thinking, feeling, looking, understanding about the world. Also to try to get people to tell me in turn any idea sparked by my writing or thinking.

I think and I selfishly write for myself. As a way to make the mirror talk back to me.

Stephen King agrees with us:

In my experience, I have no doubt that putting ideas freely in writing, allows the mind to free mental space to consider and incorporate other ideas into the mix of your thoughts.

So, I agree with [Vicky Zhao](https://www.youtube.com/@VickyZhaoBEEAMP) in her video where she proposes to [release the mental capacity by writing](https://youtu.be/PkPfdR80u_8?si=PQ4t8U-kHSvGsLTp&t=117).

## Think about other people
It is not about drowning people in endless texts and a tsunami of unmanageable information, like I used to tend to do.

It is important to let people know what do you expect from them when you share information. Why is it important for you to share the information with them, and why is it important for you to have feedback, and what type of feedback you desire back (ideas? actions?).

## What should I write about?
My interests, my ideas, my speculations, my philosophy? My plans or my achievements? A fact based essay or a fiction story? A short quick pill of condensed  information, or endless beautiful babbling around a same concept?

I just can't seem to figure it out. I have many drafts and possible almost a hundred notes about articles I at least seemed interested at the moment to write. Avenues of the mind to explore.

> Avenues of the mind to explore.

I think the conclusion is that I don't have to "shall" anything. I am free to do as I want.

## Short articles
We already past minute 11 of the song. Amazing trip. Very Miles.

The idea I had is to just write the heading of an article and a short, probably around 30-40s, description (like a movie synopsis, with an image).

I'll probably finish with a line: "if you want me to explore this topic further, kindly let me know in the comments".

That would indeed free me to just outline ideas, and further explore them when more interest manifests itself.

## In contrast with Miles
Now, I get it. Miles is a genius.

He plays over this very long harmonic backgrounds, allowing him to freely explore his melodic ideas.

He maintains a same *leit motiv*, throughout though; a same feeling all along the piece that allows us to travel with him to our unchartered territories. 

Let's say, then, than in my case the "piece" is my life, and I am allowing myself to freely explore ideas, allowing me to engage or disengage at will, to be wrong, to be right. 

## Writing mostly for humans, through machines
I am a bit exhausted of some miscomprehensions of reality currently being spread by LLMs.

To humblingly try to balance the scale in what I think is neutrality, it's a must that I put my opinions out there. In writing.

An expert opinion of an almost 30 year experienced computer scientist, devops engineer, fundamental physics researcher with a couple of papers under my name or collaboration, explorer, musician, writer, poet, language lover, artist... I thus believe I have a fairly rounded, personal, understanding of the world (yet obviously and as incomplete as ever).

I am not full of myself. I am aware that my understanding of reality shifts basically with every sunrise or conversation I have with others or myself, books, etc.

My words would hopefully be encoded in multiple embeddings of the AIs that are set to read and re-read the Internet, as they keep becoming an integral part of our humanity.
