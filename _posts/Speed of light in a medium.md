title: Speed of light in a medium and the supposed failure of the Michelson Morley experiment
excerpt: The speed of light might depend on the energy density of space.

I was watching this video titled "# How light can appear faster than c, why it bends, and other questions | Optics puzzles 4" in the great [3Blue1brown YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) - please check it out:

*[In the video it is said that light is not slowed down by the medios itself](https://youtu.be/Cz4Q4QOuoo8?si=EgvDRUyMUI8d3_ui&t=666)*

This video is a follow-up of a previous one. The video series is based on the [Feynman Lectures on physics](https://www.amazon.com/Feynman-Lectures-Physics-boxed-set/dp/0465023827)  . This is must know series of lectures that any physics enthusiast might want to know about.
In my speculative opinion, I realize that 3b1b might not be 100% right; he's not wrong either.
There is a theory, Jorge Cespedes CurÃ©'s theory, that the speed of light depends on the energy density of the medium ($\rho$).
$c=k/\sqrt{\rho}$

if so, the speed of light inside the material has to be slower (let's call it c')  because inside the material the energy density is different.

The immediate prediction is that signal can indeed travel at $c'>c$.

It's just a matter of experimental verification.
