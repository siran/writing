I am a researcher at heart.

Nobody pays me to do research, though.

Yet I don't think I want to do anything else. Even improvising music is a type of inner research where I am not looking for any answers and yet I am exploring my being.

I'll just continue for now and see where these ideas I've been having lately all lead to.

The ideas are based on an experiment I did with two "colleagues" of mine. One being an ex business partner of my father. The other being one of my college teachers.

The experiment is [published on Reasearch Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369529273_Daily_variations_of_the_amplitude_of_the_fringe_shifts_observed_when_an_air-glass_Mach-Zehnder_type_interferometer_is_rotated_-_a_preliminary_report#fullTextFileContent) .

If we did everything right it should right the wrong of Michelson and Morley conclusions of their famous experiment.

Says Wikipedia, but most importantly it stands to reasons, that << ...of this experiment, Albert Einstein wrote, "If the Michelson–Morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment, no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a (halfway) redemption.">> [^1]

More details about this experiment in the near future.  Also people ask me a lot about the implication of the results. I also intent to write more about this in the near future.

For now, I am thinking ways to replicate the results with a completely different technique: if one points a laser to the North direction, it would take `0.3ns` for light to propagate `1m`; since the Earth translates around the sun a simple calculation expect to measure about `0.1mm`

Do you spot any wrong assumptions?
