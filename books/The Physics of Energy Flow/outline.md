## Part I: What Exists

**Goal:** Establish ontological foundation without mathematics

### Chapter 1: Something Exists
- The undeniable starting point
- Observation and interaction
- The question of substance

### Chapter 2: The Same Substance
- Why interaction requires common ground
- The impossibility of truly different "stuffs"
- Energy as the fundamental substance

### Chapter 3: What We Observe
- Energy has presence (density)
- Energy changes (time evolution)
- Energy moves (spatial redistribution)
- The empirical facts before theory

### Chapter 4: No Magic
- Energy doesn't appear from nothing
- Energy doesn't disappear into nothing
- Continuity as observation, not axiom
- The source-free constraint

---

## Part II: How to Describe Flow

**Goal:** Introduce mathematics as descriptive necessity

### Chapter 5: Describing Presence
- Energy density as scalar field u(x,t)
- Why we need position and time
- The concept of "here" and "now"
- Fields vs discrete collections

### Chapter 6: Describing Change
- Two snapshots: u(x,t₁) and u(x,t₂)
- Rates of change (derivatives)
- The time derivative ∂ₜu
- What change means physically

### Chapter 7: Describing Direction
- Change requires explanation
- The need for vectors
- Energy flux S emerges
- Three-dimensional space

### Chapter 8: The Continuity Equation
- Connecting change to flow
- ∂ₜu + ∇·S = 0
- What this equation says
- What it doesn't say

### Chapter 9: Mathematical Toolkit
- Gradient: ∇u (direction of increase)
- Divergence: ∇·S (spreading/converging)
- Curl: ∇×F (rotation/circulation)
- Integrals: ∫ (total amounts)
- Each introduced when needed, with physical meaning

## Part III: Constraints on Flow

**Goal:** Derive Maxwell from minimal principles

### Chapter 10: The Source-Free Constraint
- No point creation of energy
- ∇·S = 0 everywhere
- What this means geometrically
- Implications for flow patterns

### Chapter 11: The Need for Dynamics
- Continuity constrains but doesn't determine
- Need evolution rule: ∂ₜF = D(F)
- What makes good dynamics?
- The search for minimal rules

### Chapter 12: Why Gradients Fail
- Attempt: ∂ₜF = ∇φ
- Problem: ∂ₜ(∇·F) = ∇²φ ≠ 0
- Sources appear dynamically
- Gradient-driven flow can't be source-free

### Chapter 13: Why Curls Succeed
- Try: ∂ₜF = ∇×G
- Result: ∂ₜ(∇·F) = 0 identically
- Curl preserves divergence-free structure
- The mathematical necessity

### Chapter 14: Maxwell as Minimal Dynamics
- Two fields rotating into each other
- ∂ₜE ∝ ∇×B, ∂ₜB ∝ -∇×E
- Why exactly two fields
- This is not a choice, it's forced

### Chapter 15: Reconstructing E and B
- Given (u, S), find (E, B)
- The reconstruction theorem
- Non-uniqueness: polarization freedom
- What E and B actually represent

### Chapter 16: There Is Only Flow
- Not "two fields" but one flow
- Helical energy transport
- E and B as decomposition
- The geometric picture

## Part IV: Organized Flow

**Goal:** Show how topology creates structure

### Chapter 17: Circulation and Topology
- Divergence-free allows circulation
- Closed flow paths
- Why three dimensions matter
- Topology as constraint

### Chapter 18: The Torus
- Flow on toroidal surfaces
- Two fundamental cycles
- Integer winding numbers (m,n)
- Why integers are forced

### Chapter 19: Discrete Modes
- Standing waves on closed paths
- Frequencies from geometry
- Energy levels from topology
- No quantization postulate needed

### Chapter 20: Stable Patterns
- What makes a configuration stable?
- Knots and links
- Topological protection
- Why patterns persist

### Chapter 21: Particles as Knots
- Localized flow patterns
- Electromagnetic knots
- Mass as trapped energy
- The particle spectrum question

## Part V: Quantum Mechanics Derived

**Goal:** Show QM emerges from Maxwell

### Chapter 22: Waves from Maxwell
- The wave equation
- Propagation of field configurations
- Dispersion and bandwidth
- Carrier and envelope

### Chapter 23: The Narrow-Band Approximation
- Extracting the envelope
- Slowly varying assumption
- The parameter ε = Δω/ω
- What we're approximating

### Chapter 24: The Schrödinger Equation Emerges
- Exact derivation
- The O(ε²) error term
- Where ℏ comes from
- Where m comes from

### Chapter 25: Quantization from Geometry
- Energy levels: E = E₁₁/n²
- The Rydberg series
- ℏ = E₁₁/ω₁₁ (geometric property)
- m = E₁₁/c² (trapped energy)

### Chapter 26: What QM Approximates
- The full Maxwell dynamics
- What's lost in the approximation
- When QM is accurate (ε << 1)
- When it breaks down

### Chapter 27: No Axioms Needed
- Compare: QM postulates vs our derivation
- Hilbert space emerges
- Born rule from |ψ|²
- Everything follows from flow

## Part VI: Paradoxes Dissolved

**Goal:** Show mysteries were conceptual errors

### Chapter 28: Measurement Without Collapse
- Detector as electromagnetic structure
- Adding field to field
- Total field reorganizes
- Conditioning on observation channels

### Chapter 29: The Double-Slit Experiment
- Field goes through both slits
- There never was a particle
- Which-way detection adds potential
- Phase shifts explain everything

### Chapter 30: Entanglement is Not Mysterious
- "Two particles" = one field
- Field was never separate
- Correlation without action-at-distance
- Bell inequalities don't apply (different premise)

### Chapter 31: Tunneling Without Mystery
- Field exists everywhere
- Barrier = added field structure
- Not "penetrating" - was already there
- Multipole configurations

### Chapter 32: The EPR "Paradox"
- Einstein's question
- Why there's no paradox
- Field ontology resolves it
- No spooky action needed

### Chapter 33: Delayed Choice
- Wheeler's thought experiment
- Field doesn't "choose"
- We choose what to couple to
- Deterministic throughout

### Chapter 34: No True Isolation
- Observer is field too
- Apparatus is field too
- System is field
- One continuous field examining itself
