# Chapter 1: Something Exists

Something exists.

This is not hypothesis. To doubt it requires something to perform the doubt.

Existence is the starting point. Nothing else is.


## Observation Is Interaction

Observation is not passive.

To observe is to interact. To interact requires shared structure—a bridge
through which change propagates.

If two things shared no structure, they could not influence one another.

Therefore: everything that interacts participates in common substrate.


## Energy as Substrate

We observe:

- Effects propagate
- Influences travel
- Interactions occur


Therefore substrate exists.

We call it **energy** because in physics, energy is the conserved quantity that
manifests through change.

Energy is observed to:

- Exist in measurable amounts
- Change
- Move
- It's not created nor destroyed.


These are empirical facts.


## What Follows

If energy is the common substrate, then:

- What exists is energy distribution
- What changes is energy redistribution
- What moves is energy transport


Everything else —particles, forces, mass, quantum behavior— must arise from
patterns of transport.

That is the thesis: the flow of something is enough; this something, the only
thing there is, we call it energy.


## Summary

- Something exists
- Interaction requires shared structure
- In this book we call this substrate energy
- We describe the world as organized energy flow
