# Part II — Grids and Rydberg

One of the great successes of quantum mechanics is its ability to predict,
with remarkable precision, the energy levels of atoms—most notably hydrogen,
one of the most abundant elements in the universe.

An analogy to these energy transitions can be drawn on a napkin.
Imagine a flat rectangular sheet of paper. Draw two straight lines, from edge
to edge, crossing in the middle. Together, these lines divide the napkin into
a grid of four cells.

Increasing the number of lines on both sides of the napkin further subdivides
the surface. With two lines drawn in each direction, the surface is divided
into $3 \times 3 = 9$ cells. With three lines, into $4 \times 4 = 16$ cells,
and so on. In general, $n$ lines drawn in each direction give a grid of $n^2$
cells.

Before any lines are drawn, corresponding to level $1$ (or $n = 1$), the
surface of the napkin is undivided. We call this the ground state, and we
associate with it the first energy level, $E_1$.

Without going into further detail, it is not difficult to see that a natural
relationship can be established between these successive subdivisions and the
observed atomic energy levels, namely

$$
E_n = -\frac{E_1}{n^2}.
$$

In this picture, increasing $n$ corresponds to increasing the number of global
windings on the surface, represented here by the number of cells in the grid.
More windings impose more nodes on the same conserved surface. As the number of
nodes increases, the characteristic wavelength associated with the
configuration becomes shorter, allowing more nodes to fit on the surface.

The total energy is fixed; what changes from one level to the next is how
the surface is subdivided. Each level is characterized by the size of its
cells, with $E_n = E_1/n^2$.

Transitions between levels are related to the difference in cell sizes between
two subdivisions, and require supplying the energy
$E_1\!\left(\frac{1}{n^2}-\frac{1}{m^2}\right)$ to move from level $n$ to level
$m>n$.

In this abstract but constrained way, we recover the Rydberg series—one of the
great successes of quantum mechanics—without invoking wavefunctions, operators,
mass or chargeby viewing atomic energy levels as global subdivisions of a
conserved surface.


# The torus

To visualize a torus - a donut-shaped object, return to the flat napkin.

First, identify and glue together one pair of opposite edges of the napkin.
After this identification, the flat napkin becomes a tube. A pair of lines that
originally ended on one edge now reappear as one continuous line.

Next, take this tube and identify its two circular ends. Gluing these ends
together produces a closed surface with no boundary. The result is a donut-shaped
surface, known as a torus.

Any lines drawn on the original napkin become closed paths on the torus only if
they match their own position when crossing an identified edge. This requirement
ensures global continuity of the grid, and it's called a "continuity condition".


# Charge

Consider a standing electromagnetic wave on the surface of a torus, in a
source-free Maxwell universe.

As pictured with the napkin wrapped into a donut, the surface of a torus is
equivalent to a rectangular surface with opposite edges identified.
Electromagnetic fields on this surface must satisfy periodic boundary
-"continuity"- conditions along the two independent cycles of the torus
(analogous symbolically to the two axis, "x-axis" and "y-axis", of the napkin!).

In the absence of sources, Maxwell’s equations read

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0, \qquad
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,
$$

together with the evolution equations for $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$:

<eqs>


These equations allow nontrivial solutions on a closed surface provided the
fields form globally consistent standing waves.

On a torus, such standing waves can wrap around the two independent cycles of
the torus -along the axis of the tube, and accross the tube.

<image>

Let $m$ and $n$ denote the *integer* numbers of lines forming the grid on the
surface of the torus. The lines can thought of as nodal points --where
$\mathbb{E}$ or $\mathbb{B}$ change sign.

We can say that the torus is "characterized" by these two numbers, and so
describe such a torus as write as $(m,n)$.

A "source-free" universe means that there are no electric "charges", with radial
field lines, satisfying

$$
nabla cdot BB E = k rho = 0
$$

However closed field lines are allowed for electric and magnetic fields.

<image>

A closed field line, can be seen as a loop circulation. By Maxwell thinking,
such loop circulations generate flows tangential to the surface of a torus.

At any given patch of area tangengtial to the surface of the torus, we can think
of field lines coming in and out orthogonally to the the patch in the same
amount as to keep a net null gaussian flux, and rings around this lines, doing
vortices, or "tangential flows".

Seen in this way, the $(m,n)$ flow characterizes the flow of energy along the
field lines, and in such vortices; a measure of how much energy moves in each
orthogonal direction.

If the energy of the shell is seen as distributed on the surface of the torus,
we can say that each cell has a energy density of E/n^2 -- here, m=n. We know
that this surface has an area, that wraps the volume that is the torus.

Given that the area of a sphere of radius r is $2pir^2$, we can think of the
energy of the torus as distributed on this sphere of radius $r$ instead, where
$r$ is the distance of the shell the the torus center, where we can consider the
energy concentrated -- in a point.

So, at a distance r from the torus, we can say that there is an energy density of propotional to the energy $E$ of the torus, and the spherical shell of radius $r$.

Such a relation is a $-1/r^2$ seemingly radial one.



In this model, charge quantization emerges naturally ...

Thus, charge appears not as an added ingredient, but as a topological property
of standing electromagnetic waves on a closed surface, completing the geometric
picture introduced with grids, energy levels, and the torus.
