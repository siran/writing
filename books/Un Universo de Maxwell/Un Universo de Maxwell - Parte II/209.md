# Part II — Grids and Rydberg

One of the biggest succeses of QM is to predict with precision the energy levels
of atoms, like one of the most common in the universe: hidrogen.

An analogy to these energy transitions can be drawn on a napkin.

Imagine drawing two straight lines, from edge to edge, crossing in the middle.
Together, these lines form a grid of four cells on the napkin.

Increasing the number of lines on both sides of the napkin, the surface is
further subdivided. With two lines drawn in each direction, the surface is
divided into $3 \times 3 = 9$ cells. With three lines drawn, into
$4 \times 4 = 16$ cells, and so on. In general, $n$ lines drawn in each direction
give a grid of $n^2$ cells.

Before any lines are drawn, level $1$, or $n = 1$, the surface of the napkin is
undivided. We call this state the ground state, and we associate with it the
first energy level, $E_1$.

Without going into too much detail, it is not hard to see that an argument can
be made to relate subsequent subdivisions of the grid with the energy levels,

$$
E_n = -E_1/n^2
$$

In this picture, increasing $n$ corresponds to increasing the number of global
windings on the surface (cells on the grid). More windings impose more nodes on
the same conserved surface. As the number of nodes increases, the characteristic
wavelength associated with the configuration becomes shorter, allowing for more
nodes to be had with the same energy.

The total energy scale is fixed. What changes from one level to the next how the
surface is retessellated. Transitions between levels require supplying the
energy difference between two such global configurations.

In this abstract but constrained way, we recover the Rydberg series without
invoking wavefunctions or operators, by viewing atomic energy levels as global
retessellations of a conserved surface.
