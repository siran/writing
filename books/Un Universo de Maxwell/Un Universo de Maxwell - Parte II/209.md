# Part II — Grids and Rydberg

One of the great successes of quantum mechanics is its ability to predict,
with remarkable precision, the energy levels of atoms—most notably hydrogen,
one of the most abundant elements in the universe.

An analogy to these energy transitions can be drawn on a napkin.
Imagine a flat rectangular sheet of paper. Draw two straight lines, from edge
to edge, crossing in the middle. Together, these lines divide the napkin into
a grid of four cells.

Increasing the number of lines on both sides of the napkin further subdivides
the surface. With two lines drawn in each direction, the surface is divided
into $3 \times 3 = 9$ cells. With three lines, into $4 \times 4 = 16$ cells,
and so on. In general, $n$ lines drawn in each direction give a grid of $n^2$
cells.

Before any lines are drawn, corresponding to level $1$ (or $n = 1$), the
surface of the napkin is undivided. We call this the ground state, and we
associate with it the first energy level, $E_1$.

Without going into further detail, it is not difficult to see that a natural
relationship can be established between these successive subdivisions and the
observed atomic energy levels, namely

$$
E_n = -\frac{E_1}{n^2}.
$$

In this picture, increasing $n$ corresponds to increasing the number of global
windings on the surface, represented here by the number of cells in the grid.
More windings impose more nodes on the same conserved surface. As the number of
nodes increases, the characteristic wavelength associated with the
configuration becomes shorter, allowing more nodes to fit on the surface.

The total energy scale is fixed. What changes from one level to the next is how
the surface is retessellated. Transitions between levels require supplying the
energy difference between two such global configurations.

In this abstract but constrained way, we recover the Rydberg series—one of the
great successes of quantum mechanics—without invoking wavefunctions or
operators, by viewing atomic energy levels as global retessellations of a
conserved surface.


# The torus

To visualize a torus - a donut-shaped object, return to the flat napkin.

First, identify and glue together one pair of opposite edges of the napkin.
After this identification, the flat napkin becomes a tube. A pair of lines that
originally ended on one edge now reappear as one continuous line.

Next, take this tube and identify its two circular ends. Gluing these ends
together produces a closed surface with no boundary. The result is a donut-shaped
surface, known as a torus.

Any lines drawn on the original napkin become closed paths on the torus only if
they match their own position when crossing an identified edge. This requirement
ensures global continuity of the grid, and it's called a "continuity condition".
