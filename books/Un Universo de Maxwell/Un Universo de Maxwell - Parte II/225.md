### From Spectral Structure to Mechanics

In the preceding chapter, we showed that discrete spectral structure—exemplified
by the Rydberg series—arises naturally when electromagnetic fields are confined
by global continuity conditions. Discreteness emerged not from particles,
forces, or quantization rules, but from topology: the requirement that a field
defined on a compact configuration match itself after completing closed cycles.

At that stage, the discussion concerned only internal structure: how energy
redistributes within a self-confined electromagnetic configuration. Yet a
question remains unavoidable. If such configurations are to be identified with
ordinary matter, how do they move? How do they carry momentum, resist
acceleration, and obey the conservation laws that govern everyday mechanics?

The answer cannot be imported from Newtonian axioms or particle models, because
neither exists in a Maxwell Universe. If mechanics is to arise at all, it must
arise from electromagnetic field dynamics alone.

The purpose of the present chapter is to show that it does—inevitably.


## Conservation Laws in a Maxwell Universe

In a Maxwell Universe, the electromagnetic field is the only fundamental entity.
There are no particles, no intrinsic masses, and no independent mechanical
postulates. All physical objects are structured, self-confined electromagnetic
field configurations evolving according to the source-free Maxwell equations,

$$
\nabla\cdot\vec{E}=0,\qquad
\nabla\cdot\vec{B}=0,\qquad
\nabla\times\vec{E}=-\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t},\qquad
\nabla\times\vec{B}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t}.
$$

These four equations supply the entire dynamics. What we call “matter” is nothing
more than a persistent solution of these equations.


### Energy and Momentum Are Field Properties

Maxwell’s theory assigns energy and momentum directly to fields. The local
electromagnetic energy density is

$$
u=\tfrac12\bigl(\epsilon_0|\vec{E}|^2+\mu_0^{-1}|\vec{B}|^2\bigr),
$$

and the flow of this energy is given by the Poynting vector,

$$
\vec{S}=\mu_0^{-1}\,\vec{E}\times\vec{B}.
$$

Momentum is not an added concept; it is already present in the field. The
momentum density is

$$
\vec{g}=\frac{\vec{S}}{c^2}=\epsilon_0\,\vec{E}\times\vec{B}.
$$

For any localized electromagnetic configuration occupying a region $V$, the
total momentum is therefore

$$
\vec{P}=\int_V \vec{g}\,d^3x.
$$

No mass parameter has been introduced.


### Why Momentum Is Conserved

The conservation of momentum follows directly from Maxwell dynamics.
Differentiating the momentum density and using Maxwell’s equations yields the
local balance law

$$
\frac{\partial\vec{g}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{T}=0,
$$

where $\mathbf{T}$ is the Maxwell stress tensor,

$$
T_{ij}=\epsilon_0\!\left(E_iE_j+c^2B_iB_j
-\tfrac12\delta_{ij}(|\vec{E}|^2+c^2|\vec{B}|^2)\right).
$$

Integrating over a volume $V$ gives

$$
\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}
=-\!\int_{\partial V}\mathbf{T}\cdot d\vec{A}.
$$

Momentum changes only when electromagnetic stress crosses the boundary. For a
self-confined configuration whose external fields cancel on $\partial V$, the
surface integral vanishes and $\vec{P}$ remains constant.

Momentum conservation is therefore not a postulate, but a consequence of
source-free Maxwell dynamics.


### Inertia Without Mass

Define the total electromagnetic energy in $V$,

$$
U=\int_V u\,d^3x,
$$

and the center of energy,

$$
\vec{R}(t)=\frac{1}{U}\int_V \vec{r}\,u\,d^3x.
$$

Electromagnetic field theory gives the exact relation

$$
\vec{P}=U\,\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}.
$$

If $\vec{P}$ is constant, then $d\vec{R}/dt$ is constant. A localized
electromagnetic configuration therefore moves at uniform velocity unless acted
upon by external electromagnetic stress.

This is inertia.


### Angular Momentum and Rotation

Electromagnetic fields also carry angular momentum. The angular-momentum density
is

$$
\vec{\ell}=\vec{r}\times\vec{g},
$$

and the total angular momentum is

$$
\vec{L}=\int_V \vec{r}\times(\epsilon_0\,\vec{E}\times\vec{B})\,d^3x.
$$

Its evolution obeys

$$
\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}
=-\!\int_{\partial V}\vec{r}\times(\mathbf{T}\cdot d\vec{A}).
$$

Angular momentum is conserved whenever no torque crosses the boundary. A
self-confined electromagnetic configuration with internal circulation will
rotate indefinitely unless acted upon by an external stress.

Rotational inertia is the persistence of circulating field momentum.


### What a “Force” Is

In a Maxwell Universe, a force is not primitive. A push is simply an external
electromagnetic field overlapping a localized configuration. During the overlap,

$$
\vec{E}_{\text{tot}}=\vec{E}+\vec{E}_{\text{ext}},\qquad
\vec{B}_{\text{tot}}=\vec{B}+\vec{B}_{\text{ext}},
$$

and the momentum density becomes

$$
\vec{g}_{\text{tot}}=\epsilon_0\,\vec{E}_{\text{tot}}\times\vec{B}_{\text{tot}}.
$$

Momentum is redistributed through electromagnetic stress. After the interaction
ends, the configuration relaxes into a new steady state with a different total
momentum.


### Emergence of Newton’s Second Law

Define an effective inertial measure,

$$
m_{\text{eff}}=\frac{U}{c^2}.
$$

Since $\vec{P}=U\,\vec{v}$ with $\vec{v}=d\vec{R}/dt$, we have

$$
\vec{P}=m_{\text{eff}}\vec{v}.
$$

Differentiating and identifying stress-tensor flux as the external influence
yields

$$
\vec{F}_{\text{ext}}=m_{\text{eff}}\vec{a}.
$$

Newton’s second law is not fundamental. It is an identity expressing how
electromagnetic stress changes field momentum.


### What This Means

All classical mechanical behavior—translation, rotation, inertia, and
conservation laws—emerges directly from source-free Maxwell dynamics. No
particles, intrinsic masses, or auxiliary axioms are required.

In a Maxwell Universe, mechanics is not imposed on matter.
Mechanics is the natural behavior of structured electromagnetic fields.


### Topology, Energy, and Motion

The same global constraints that discretize the internal energy of a
self-confined electromagnetic configuration also govern its external behavior.

In the Rydberg analysis, standing-wave conditions on compact configurations
forced energy into discrete modes labeled by integers. These integers were not
introduced by hand; they were the unavoidable consequence of field continuity on
closed cycles.

Momentum and angular momentum arise from the same logic. They are not attributes
of particles, but integrals of electromagnetic energy flow. Their conservation is
not imposed as a principle; it follows from the absence of stress flux across the
boundary of a closed configuration.

Thus, spectral structure and mechanical behavior are not separate domains.
Quantized internal organization and classical motion are two aspects of the same
electromagnetic reality: globally constrained, source-free Maxwell fields.

Once matter is recognized as a self-sustained electromagnetic configuration, the
emergence of inertia and conservation laws is no longer surprising. It is the
only outcome consistent with Maxwell dynamics.


## Self-Refraction and Electromagnetic Stability

In the preceding analysis of inertia, we treated a localized electromagnetic
configuration as a given—a bounded distribution of energy with total energy
$U$. We must now explain why such a configuration can exist at all, given the
well-known tendency of electromagnetic waves to disperse in free space.

In a Maxwell Universe, there is no container and no material substrate. There is
only the electromagnetic field itself. Any mechanism of confinement must
therefore arise from the field’s own dynamics. We call this mechanism
**self-refraction**.


### Self-Generated Electromagnetic Environment

Refraction does not require matter; it requires a phase-delayed electromagnetic
response. In ordinary media, this response is attributed to bound charges. In a
Maxwell Universe, the response must instead arise from the field configuration
itself.

A self-sustained electromagnetic structure continuously generates secondary
electromagnetic fields through its internal dynamics. These secondary fields are
phase-delayed relative to the primary energy flow. An electromagnetic wave
propagating within such a configuration therefore propagates not through empty
space, but through an electromagnetic environment created by the configuration
itself.

The configuration thus acts as its own effective medium.


### Energy Flow and Closure

The local flow of electromagnetic energy is described by the Poynting vector,

$$
\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\,\vec{E} \times \vec{B}.
$$

Stability requires that energy not escape to infinity. This condition is not
$\vec{S} = 0$, but rather **closure**:

$$
\oint_{\partial V} \vec{S}\cdot d\vec{A} = 0 .
$$

Inside the region $V$, energy continues to move. However, its flow is redirected
by the phase structure of the self-generated electromagnetic environment so that
it forms closed or recurrent paths. Energy circulates rather than radiates.

This closed circulation of energy is the precise meaning of electromagnetic
self-confinement.


### Self-Refraction Without Modified Maxwell Equations

No modification of Maxwell’s equations is required. The equations remain linear
and source-free everywhere. The apparent bending of energy flow arises not from
nonlinearity, but from interference between primary fields and secondary,
phase-delayed fields generated by the configuration itself.

Equivalently, the redistribution of electromagnetic energy and momentum encoded
in the cross terms of the total field produces a spacetime-dependent structure
that continuously redirects propagation. Phase delay and energy redistribution
are two descriptions of the same process.

Self-refraction is therefore a consequence of **field–field interaction with
memory**, not of altered constitutive laws.


### Topological Closure

Local closure of energy flow is not sufficient. For long-lived stability, the
closure condition must be satisfied globally. This imposes topological
constraints on the field configuration.

Configurations possessing non-contractible cycles—such as toroidal or knotted
structures—naturally support persistent circulation of electromagnetic energy.
Global continuity conditions force the field to reproduce itself after traversal
of closed paths, preventing decay through destructive interference.

The integers labeling these cycles are not imposed externally; they arise from
the requirement of self-consistent phase closure.


### Stability as Identity

A self-sustained electromagnetic configuration persists because its own fields
generate the delayed response required to redirect subsequent propagation. The
configuration exists not despite dispersion, but because dispersion is exactly
balanced by self-refraction.

Matter, in this view, is not light trapped by an external medium.
Matter is electromagnetic energy whose own self-generated field structure
continuously refracts it into closed, self-consistent circulation.

In a Maxwell Universe, stability, discreteness, and mechanics are not additional principles. They are the global consequences of energy flow that closes on itself.
