This part does not introduce new equations, new forces, or new postulates.
It revisits familiar results under a single restriction: **only source-free
Maxwell dynamics are assumed**.

Throughout this work, “particle”, “mass”, and “charge” are names given to
self-confined, self-sustained electromagnetic field configurations. They are not
assumed as microscopic primitives.

This text does not proceed by axioms and deductions, but by re-anchoring familiar
results in a different ontology. The order reflects conceptual recognition
rather than pedagogical construction.

The guiding observation is simple:
**the same equations already contain more structure than we usually allow
ourselves to see.**

Discrete spectra, inertia, charge, and stability appear not as added principles,
but as consequences of global closure, continuity, and energy flow in Maxwell’s
theory.

The Rydberg series is taken as the point of entry—not as a historical curiosity,
but as direct evidence that electromagnetic fields, when globally constrained,
organize energy discretely without invoking particles, forces, or quantization
rules.

From this anchor, the remaining properties of matter—mass, motion, charge, and
stability—are traced back to the same source:
**electromagnetic energy constrained to close on itself.**
