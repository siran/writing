# The Rydberg Series

One of the greatest achievements of the initial Quantum Mechanics was predicting
the *discrete* values of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, also known as
*The Rydberg series*. This series is the name given to the specific pattern of
color (light frequencies) emitted by excited hydrogen atoms (like in a neon
light, a hydrogen light), formalized by Johannes Rydberg in the late 19th
century.

Long before the structure of the atom was understood, experiments showed that
glowing hydrogen does not emit a continuous rainbow of light (like Newton showed
that sunlight is composed of). Instead, it emits light only at very specific,
sharp colors.

Rydberg noticed that these frequencies followed a precise, simple mathematical
relationship involving integers ($n=1, 2, 3...$). The energy of the light scales
exactly with the inverse square of these integers:

$$
E_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}.
$$

The standard explanation (by Niels Bohr and later Erdwin Schrödinger) tied this
energy scaling to distance of the electron to the proton (the nucleus of a
hydrogen atom is considered of being only a proton): in a "planetary" view of
the atom, higher $n$ means the electron is physically farther from the nucleus.
Since the electrostatic attraction drops with distance, the energy drops.

However, the formula itself makes no reference to space or radius—only to the
integer $n$.


# Energy Reorganization

There is an alternative to the "distance" view, if we think of energy as
distributed over the surface of a torus.

We can interpret the $1/n^2$ factor not as a change in size, but as a
reorganization of energy into tighter and tighter $n \times n = n^2$ cells.

Consider a closed surface, like a torus -a donut shaped *surface*-, with a fixed
total area.

If a wave winds around this surface $n$ times in both orthogonal directions
(along the axis of the tube of the donut and around the ring itself), it
effectively partitions the surface into a grid of distinct regions.

To exist as a stable structure, the field must satisfy "continuity conditions."
This means the electromagnetic field must be well-defined at every point on the
surface: a measurement taken at any patch must be consistent with expectation,
yielding the same value every time the wave traverses the loop.

The number of these distinct regions scales as $n \times n = n^2$.

The energy can thus be thought of as being reorganized into tighter cells as the
atom gets more excited. When distributed in this way, the energy allocated to
each region drops exactly as $1/n^2$, matching the Rydberg series.

In this view, the Rydberg series does not describe an electron jumping to a
farther orbit. It describes the electromagnetic field reorganizing itself into
finer, more complex knots of counter-propagating electromagnetic energy flux,
forming standing waves.
