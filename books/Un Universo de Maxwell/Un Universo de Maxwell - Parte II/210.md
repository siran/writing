# The Rydberg Series

One of the greatest achievements of early quantum theory was predicting the
*discrete* energy levels of the hydrogen atom, known as the *Rydberg series*.
This series describes the specific colors (frequencies) of light emitted by
excited hydrogen atoms, formalized empirically by Johannes Rydberg in the late
19th century.

Long before the internal structure of the atom was understood, experiments
showed that glowing hydrogen does not emit a continuous rainbow of light (as
Newton showed sunlight does, decomposing light using a prism). Instead, it emits
light only at very specific, sharply defined colors.

Rydberg found that these frequencies follow a simple mathematical pattern
involving integers \( n = 1, 2, 3, \dots \). The emitted photon energies scale
with the inverse square of these integers:

$$
E_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}.
$$

The standard explanation, developed by Niels Bohr and later formalized by Erwin
Schrödinger, ties this scaling to the electrostatic (Coulomb) interaction between
an electron and a proton, reminiscent of a planetary view of the atom.

In this picture, larger \( n \) corresponds to the electron occupying a state
that is, on average, farther from the nucleus. Since the electrostatic
interaction weakens with distance, the binding energy—the energy required to
remove the electron from the proton—decreases accordingly.

However, the formula itself contains no reference to distance, radius, or
geometry—only to the integer \( n \).


# Energy Reorganization

We can interpret the $1/n^2$ factor not as a change in size, but as a
reorganization of energy into tighter and tighter $n \times n = n^2$ cells.

Consider a closed surface, such as a torus—a donut-shaped *surface*—with fixed
total area.

If an electromagnetic wave configuration winds around this surface \( n \) times
in each of the two independent directions (along the axis of the tube and around
the ring), the field must satisfy global continuity conditions.

To be stable, the wave phase must match itself upon closing the loop. This leads
to a natural quantization: the total path length \( L \) of the winding
configuration must accommodate an integer number of wavelengths.

Since the winding number is \( n \) in both directions, the total length of the
electromagnetic circulation scales linearly with \( n \):

$$
L_n \propto n.
$$


Crucially, this combined winding partitions the surface into a grid of distinct
regions. Because the wave winds \( n \) times poloidally and \( n \) times
toroidally, the grid intersects itself to form a lattice of cells. The number of
such regions scales as:

$$
n \times n = n^2.
$$

The total electromagnetic energy of the configuration is conserved. As the
number of regions increases, this fixed energy is redistributed among a larger
number of distinct cells.

The energy associated with each region therefore decreases exactly as:

$$
E \propto \frac{1}{n^2},
$$

reproducing the Rydberg scaling.

In this view, the Rydberg series does not describe an electron jumping to a
farther orbit in space. It describes the electromagnetic field reorganizing
itself into finer, more complex standing-wave patterns—knots of
counter-propagating electromagnetic energy flux constrained by topology.
