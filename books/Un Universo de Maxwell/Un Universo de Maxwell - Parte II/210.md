# The Rydberg Series

One of the greatest achievements of early quantum theory was predicting the
*discrete* energy levels of the hydrogen atom, known as the *Rydberg series*.
This series describes the specific colors (frequencies) of light emitted by
excited hydrogen atoms (and many other atoms), formalized empirically by the
Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg in 1888.

Long before the internal structure of the atom was understood, experiments
showed that glowing hydrogen does not emit a continuous rainbow of light (as
Isaac Newton demonstrated by decomposing sunlight with a prism). Instead, it
emits light only at very specific, sharply defined colors.

Rydberg found that these frequencies follow a simple mathematical pattern
involving integers $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$. The emitted photon energies scale with
the inverse square of these integers:


$$
E_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}.
$$



The standard explanation, developed by Niels Bohr (1885–1962) and later
formalized by Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961), ties this scaling to the
electrostatic (Coulomb) interaction between an electron and a proton,
reminiscent of a planetary view of the atom.

In this picture, larger $n$ corresponds to the electron occupying a state
that is, on average, farther from the nucleus. Since the electrostatic
interaction weakens with distance, the binding energy—the energy required to
free the electron from the proton’s pull—decreases accordingly.

However, the formula itself contains no reference to distance, radius, or
geometry—only to the integer $n$.


# Energy Reorganization

We can interpret the $1/n^2$ factor not as a change in spatial size, but as a
reorganization of energy into progressively finer structure.

Consider a closed surface, such as a torus—a donut-shaped *surface*—with fixed
total area. The torus is not a claim about atomic shape, but a minimal example of
a compact manifold with two non-contractible cycles. Any compact electromagnetic
configuration with two independent winding numbers yields the same $n^2$
scaling.

If an electromagnetic wave winds around this surface $n$ times in each of the
two independent directions (along the axis of the tube and around the ring), the
field must satisfy global continuity conditions. After each complete traversal
of a loop, the field must reproduce itself to avoid destructive interference.

This imposes a discretization condition on the wavelength. Along a closed loop
of length $L$, the field must satisfy:

$$
n \lambda = L .
$$

These are the same continuity conditions that produce standing waves on a string
or in a cavity, now applied to a closed surface with two independent cycles.

The combined winding partitions the surface into a grid of distinct regions. The
number of such regions scales as:

$$
n \times n = n^2 .
$$

The total electromagnetic energy of the configuration is conserved. As the
number of regions increases, this fixed energy is redistributed among a larger
number of distinct cells. The energy associated with each region therefore
decreases as:

$$
E \propto \frac{1}{n^2},
$$

reproducing the Rydberg scaling.

In this view, the Rydberg series does not describe an electron moving to a larger
orbit in space. It describes the electromagnetic field reorganizing itself into
progressively finer standing-wave patterns—self-consistent knots of
counter-propagating electromagnetic energy flux, governed by global continuity
rather than force balance.


# Charge as Topology

Because

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0
$$

everywhere, no electric field originates from a point. All electromagnetic flow
is closed.

Consider a self-sustained electromagnetic configuration confined to a compact
region of space. Enclose this configuration within a spherical surface of radius
$r$ much larger than the structure itself. The enclosing area grows as
$4\pi r^2$.

The total electromagnetic circulation is conserved. As this fixed quantity is
distributed over a surface whose area grows with $r^2$, the observed field
intensity necessarily falls off as $1/r^2$.

This reproduces the phenomenology of charge.

In this view, charge is not a primitive source but an effective, topological
quantity: a measure of electromagnetic circulation associated with a
self-sustained field configuration. What appears as charge at large distances is
the far-field signature of closed electromagnetic energy flow.


# Matter

In this framework, matter is not a substrate distinct from the field.

Matter is a self-sustained electromagnetic field configuration whose internal
couplings generate delayed response, confinement, and stability.

All effective material properties—mass, charge, inertia, and spectral
structure—emerge from globally constrained, source-free electromagnetic
dynamics.
