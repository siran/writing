PART II

This part is not meant to be pedagogical in a mathematical sense. In this spirit,
equations will be written both in prose and in symbols, so that a non-technical
reader may follow the argument.

It is a conceptual draft: a somewhat coherent line of reasoning, stripped of
unnecessary assumptions.


# Matter and Mass

The concept of matter long predates the concept of mass.

In antiquity, matter meant simply “that which exists.” As early as the 5th
century BCE, the Greek atomists Leucippus and Democritus proposed that the world
consisted solely of indivisible units (atoms) moving through infinite empty space.

Democritus famously noted, "By convention sweet is sweet, bitter is bitter, hot
is hot, cold is cold, color is color; but in truth there are only atoms and the
void." In this view, matter was defined by its geometric imperishability.

In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle took a different approach, formalizing matter
as *substance* (*hylē*): that which underlies form and change. For Aristotle,
matter was potentiality waiting to be given shape.

Many centuries later, during the Renaissance in the 17th century, Isaac Newton
introduced mass for the first time as an operational quantity. His goal was not
philosophical ontology, but prediction. He needed a parameter to quantify how
objects resist changes in motion.

In the *Principia* (1687), mass enters as the parameter governing the response
to forces. It was defined operationally, not structurally.

Newton wrote mass as the “quantity of matter,” but he never defined matter
itself. Mass was introduced to quantify motion—from falling objects to the
orbits of planets—not to explain microscopic constitution.

Newton formalized the observation that matter in motion tends to remain in
motion unless acted upon by a force. He called this conserved quantity the
"quantity of motion"—mass times velocity—denoted $p$:

$$
p = m v .
$$

The momentum $p$ of an object—its tendency to preserve its state of motion—is
taken as a basic fact of the universe in all modern theories. Inertia, the
resistance to acceleration, is treated as intrinsic.

As Nobel laureate Richard Feynman emphasized in his *Lectures on Physics*,
physics contains no explanation of inertia. We know how to calculate with it,
but not what it is.

Changes in momentum over time, $dp/dt$, are explained by the action of a force
$F$:

$$
F = \frac{dp}{dt} = m \frac{dv}{dt} = m a .
$$

This was a remarkably accurate empirical framework. It explained terrestrial
mechanics, planetary motion, and celestial dynamics with unprecedented
precision. It literally made rocket science possible, taking humanity to the
Moon and beyond.

Newton’s concept of mass survived even the radical reformulation of space and
time introduced by Albert Einstein. In general relativity, mass is said to tell
spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells mass how to move.

The concept of Newtonian mass $m$ penetrated even Quantum Mechanics. In Erwin
Schrödinger's wave equation, mass appears in a familiar position:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V \right] \psi .
$$

The term inside the brackets represents the total energy. Notice the fraction
containing mass. In quantum mechanics, the operator corresponding to momentum
squared, $p^2$, is $-\hbar^2\nabla^2$.

Thus, the first term is exactly the kinetic energy expression from classical
mechanics, re-written in operator form:

$$
\text{Kinetic Energy} = \frac{p^2}{2m}.
$$

Mass $m$ remains the denominator of motion. It is an external parameter inserted
into the theory to make the units of momentum work. It is still nowadays a
heavily debated conundrum how to join into a single theory Newton's
gravitational mass (extended by Einstein to General Relativity) with Quantum
Mechanics.


# Charge Follows the Same Pattern

Many decades after Newton, electric charge entered physics in an analogous way.

Coulomb established experimentally that electric forces obey an inverse-square
law:

$$
|\mathbf{F}| \propto \frac{1}{r^2}.
$$

Charge was introduced as the quantity that sources this force.

Following the success of point masses, Maxwell later encoded charge as a source
term in the electric field:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho / \epsilon_0 .
$$

As with mass, charge is treated as primitive: something localized that produces
a field.

This treatment mirrors the historical role of mass. It works to an amazing
extent, while remaining silent about microscopic structure.


# Light in Matter and Linear Response

When light enters a material, it is commonly said to slow down.

Yet Maxwell’s equations assign a single propagation speed to electromagnetic
waves:

$$
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}.
$$

The observed reduction in speed does not arise because light itself changes its
nature. It arises because the material becomes polarized.

The incident wave drives bound charges, which emit secondary electromagnetic
radiation. The superposition of the incident and secondary fields produces a
phase delay.

The effective phase velocity becomes

$$
v = \frac{c}{n}.
$$

This mechanism is fully electromagnetic and requires no modification of
Maxwell’s equations.


# Polarization Is a Field

The linear response of a medium is written as

$$
\mathbf{P} = \chi \mathbf{E},
$$

where $\mathbf{P}$ is the polarization field.

Polarization is commonly taught as the displacement of physical charges. But
mathematically, it is simply an electric field generated in response to another
electric field.

Nothing in Maxwell’s equations requires $\mathbf{P}$ to originate from "solid"
matter. It is simply another electromagnetic vector field.

Thus, electromagnetic waves do interact. Superposition and linearity do not
imply non-interaction.


# Superposition Is Not Non-Interaction

Linearity means fields add.
It does not mean physics is insensitive to the sum.

Electromagnetic energy density is quadratic:

$$
u = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(
\epsilon_0 |\mathbf{E}|^2 + \mu_0^{-1} |\mathbf{B}|^2
\right).
$$

For $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{E}_2$, the energy density becomes:

$$
|\mathbf{E}|^2
= |\mathbf{E}_1|^2 + |\mathbf{E}_2|^2
+ 2\,\mathbf{E}_1 \cdot \mathbf{E}_2,
$$

and similarly for $\mathbf{B}$.

The cross terms ($2\,\mathbf{E}_1 \cdot \mathbf{E}_2$) are unavoidable.
They represent real redistribution of energy and momentum.

Interaction occurs through the total field configuration, without violating
linearity.


# Structure Without Sources

Consider electromagnetism with no sources:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0, \qquad
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0.
$$

This forbids divergence, not structure.

Closed electromagnetic configurations remain allowed. Just as a smoke ring is a
stable structure in air without being "made" of a different material than the
air around it, electromagnetic structures can exist within the field itself.


# The Torus and Discretization

A torus possesses two independent non-contractible loops.
An electromagnetic field defined on a torus must match itself after traversal of
each loop.

These global continuity conditions discretize the allowed configurations.

Let $(m,n)$ denote the integer winding numbers along the two cycles.

A standing electromagnetic wave on a torus is therefore characterized by
$(m,n)$.


# Energy and the Rydberg Structure

The total electromagnetic energy is conserved.

Increasing the winding numbers subdivides the surface into more regions. Each
region carries a smaller fraction of the total energy.

For symmetric configurations $(m=n)$,

$$
E_n = \frac{E_0}{n^2}.
$$

This reproduces the Rydberg series observed in atomic spectra.

Asymmetric configurations $(m \neq n)$ carry net circulation and therefore an
electromagnetic moment.


# Charge as Topology

Because $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ everywhere, no electric field originates
from a point.

All electromagnetic flow is closed.

However, consider the "intensity" of this configuration observed from a
distance. Enclose the toroidal configuration within a spherical surface of
radius $r$ much larger than the torus.

The enclosing area scales as $4\pi r^2$.

The total electromagnetic circulation (energy flow) is conserved, much like the
total light output of a bulb. As this fixed quantity is distributed over the
surface of the growing sphere, the density per unit area must decrease.

Because the area grows as $r^2$, the observed density produces an effective
$1/r^2$ dependence.

What is interpreted experimentally as a radial electric field sourced by charge
is, in this description, the macroscopic imprint of a closed, divergence-free
electromagnetic circulation being diluted over distance.

Charge is thus not primitive. It is an effective, topological quantity: a
measure of organized electromagnetic energy density, labeled by $(m,n)$.
