# The Rydberg Series

One of the greatest achievements of early quantum theory was predicting the
*discrete* energy levels of the hydrogen atom, known as the *Rydberg series*.
This series describes the specific colors (frequencies) of light emitted by
excited hydrogen atoms, formalized empirically by Johannes Rydberg in the late
19th century.

Long before the internal structure of the atom was understood, experiments
showed that glowing hydrogen does not emit a continuous rainbow of light (as
Newton demonstrated by decomposing sunlight with a prism). Instead, it emits
light only at very specific, sharply defined colors.

Rydberg found that these frequencies follow a simple mathematical pattern
involving integers $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$. The emitted photon energies scale
with the inverse square of these integers:


$$
E_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}.
$$

The standard explanation, developed by Niels Bohr and later formalized by Erwin
Schrödinger, ties this scaling to the electrostatic (Coulomb) interaction
between an electron and a proton, reminiscent of a planetary view of the atom.

In this picture, larger $n$ corresponds to the electron occupying a state
that is, on average, farther from the nucleus. Since the electrostatic
interaction weakens with distance, the binding energy—the energy required to
free the electron from the proton's pull—decreases accordingly.

However, the formula itself contains no reference to distance, radius, or
geometry—only to the integer $n$.


# Energy Reorganization

We can interpret the $1/n^2$ factor not as a change in spatial size, but as a
reorganization of energy into progressively finer structure.

Consider a closed surface, such as a torus—a donut-shaped *surface*—with fixed
total area.

If an electromagnetic wave winds around this surface $n$ times in each of
the two independent directions (along the axis of the tube and around the
ring), the field must satisfy global continuity conditions. After each complete
traversal of a loop, the field must reproduce itself to avoid destructive
interference.

This imposes a discretization condition on the wavelength. Along a closed
loop of length $L$, the field must satisfy:

$$
n \lambda = L .
$$

These are the same continuity conditions that produce standing waves on a
string or in a cavity, now applied to a closed surface with two independent
cycles.



The combined winding partitions the surface into a grid of distinct regions.
The number of such regions scales as:

$$
n \times n = n^2 .
$$

The total electromagnetic energy of the configuration is conserved. As the
number of regions increases, this fixed energy is redistributed among a larger
number of distinct cells.

The energy associated with each region therefore decreases as:

$$
E \propto \frac{1}{n^2},
$$

reproducing the Rydberg scaling.

In this view, the Rydberg series does not describe an electron jumping to a
farther orbit in space. It describes the electromagnetic field reorganizing
itself into finer, more complex standing-wave patterns—knots of
counter-propagating electromagnetic energy flux constrained by topology.
