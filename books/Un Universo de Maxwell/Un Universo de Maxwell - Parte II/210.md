# The Rydberg Series

*The Rydberg Series* is the name given to the specific pattern of light
frequencies emitted by excited hydrogen atoms, formalized by Johannes Rydberg in
the late 19th century.

Long before the structure of the atom was understood, experiments showed that
glowing hydrogen does not emit a continuous rainbow of light. Instead, it emits
light only at very specific, sharp colors.

Rydberg discovered that these frequencies followed a precise, simple mathematical
relationship involving integers ($n=1, 2, 3...$). The energy of the light scales
exactly with the inverse square of these integers:

$$
E_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}.
$$


The standard explanation (Bohr and later Schrödinger) tied this energy scaling
to **distance**. In the "planetary" view of the atom, higher $n$ means the
electron is physically farther from the nucleus. Since the electrostatic
attraction drops with distance, the energy drops.

However, the formula itself makes no reference to space or radius —only to the
integer $n$.


# Energy Reorganization

There is an alternative to the "distance" view, if we think of energy as
distributed over the surface of a torus.

We can interpret the $1/n^2$ factor not as a change in size, but as a
reorganization of energy into tighter and tighter $n \times n = n^2$ cells.

Consider a closed surface, like a torus, with a fixed total area. If a wave
winds around this surface $n$ times in both orthogonal directions (along the
axis of the tube and around the ring itself), it effectively partitions the
surface into a grid of distinct regions.

To exist as a stable structure, the field must satisfy "continuity reasons."
This means the electromagnetic field must be well-defined at every point on the
surface: a measurement taken at any patch must be consistent with expectation,
yielding the same value every time the wave traverses the loop.

The number of these distinct regions scales as $n \times n = n^2$.

The energy can thus be thought of as being reorganized into tighter cells as the
atom gets more excited. When distributed in this way, the energy allocated to
each region drops exactly as $1/n^2$, matching the Rydberg series.

In this view, the Rydberg series does not describe an electron jumping to a
farther orbit. It describes the electromagnetic field reorganizing itself into
finer, more complex knots of counter-propagating electromagnetic energy flux,
forming standing waves.
