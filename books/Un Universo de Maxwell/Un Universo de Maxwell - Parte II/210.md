$PART_II$

This part is not meant to be pedagogical. It is meant to be a conceptual draft
of somewhat coherent ideas.


# Solid Objects Made of Matter

It is common to think of matter as solid. Then we learn that iron melts. And
that it can also make metal gas.

Ice melts. Water evaporates. If temperature continues to increase, water
molecules drift apart into two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen, $H_2O$, as
verified repeatedly by experiment.

If temperature increases further, hydrogen separates into an electron and a
proton. Protons, in turn, reveal further structure (“quarks”), and so on.

The electron, notably, has no known internal structure. It is treated
mathematically, it is thought of, as a point-like object with discrete mass and
charge.


# Where Is the Mass?

Mass does not need to exist beyond being a useful idea. What we call mass can be thought of as being derived from the concept of inertia, or resistante to motion.

When Newton first introduces mass as a formal concept, he did so in the context of momentum, <citation>

p = mv

where objects maintain a certain speed unless perturbed. This was an intrinsic property of the universe that even Feynman taught his child that "no one ones what inertia is". <complete citation>

When Newton introduced mass, the goal was not to understand how object where at the most tiny scales, but mostly at a macroscopic or even cosmis scales.

Recall Newtown didn't get to know Coulombs charge, and much less Maxwell's electromagnetism.

<citation> <good facts, notes, fillers welcome>


# Charge Follows the Same Path

<add dates, talk about when, how; perhaps starting with coulumn's force and his interpretation>

Following the success of point masses, Maxwell adopted Coulomb’s description of
electric interaction and encoded charge as a point-like source of the electric
field.

In differential form, this is written as

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho ,
$$

where $\rho$ is called the charge density.

As with mass, charge is treated as a primitive property: something that exists
at a point and generates a field.


A note on Gauss's law: It is not a explanation of charge, rather a measurement
of how many field lines enter of leave any closed surface. Dipoles have a zero
net Gauss flux, point-charges do not. Gauss's law labels a measured divergence
of the electric field; closed field lines are ignored.


# Light in a Medium

When light enters a material, it is commonly said to slow down — “we can measure
it.”

Others, including Richard Feynman, emphasized that there is no fundamental
reason why light itself should slow down in a material. According to Maxwell’s
equations, light propagates at $c$ in vacuum and should do so everywhere.

The observed reduction of speed arises instead because the material becomes
polarized by the incoming wave and emits a secondary electromagnetic wave that
combines with the incident one, shifting its phase.

This mechanism is fully described by Maxwell’s equations in a medium.


# Polarization

Because of the principle of superposition, electromagnetic waves are often said
not to interact with one another.

Yet when light enters a material, its electric and magnetic fields excite the
charges within the material. These charges accelerate and emit secondary
electromagnetic radiation, which *does* combine with the original wave, causing it to change phase, interpreted as a slow-down of light in matter.

The linear response of a polarizable medium is written as

$$
\mathbf{P} = \chi \mathbf{E},
$$

where $\mathbf{P}$ is the polarization field and $\chi$ characterizes the
response.

Polarization is therefore an electric field produced in response to another
electric field.

Nothing in Maxwell’s equations requires that $\mathbf{P}$ be produced by
“matter.”

It is simply another electromagnetic field.

Thus, two electromagnetic waves do interact. For the electromagnetic field,
neither superposition nor linearity mean non-interaction.

The cross term can be seen in the energy density formula:

<show>

So they interact not by violating linearity, but through the energy density and
momentum carried by their superposition.


# Superposition Is Not Non-Interaction

Linearity means that fields add.
It does not mean that physics is insensitive to the sum.

The electromagnetic energy density depends quadratically on the fields:

$$
u = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon_0 |\mathbf{E}|^2 + \mu_0^{-1} |\mathbf{B}|^2\right).
$$

<show obvious cross term of the notable product of E_1+E_2>

When two waves overlap, cross terms appear.
Energy and momentum are redistributed.

Interaction occurs through the total field configuration.


# The Torus

Consider now a universe governed by Maxwell’s equations with no sources:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0, \qquad
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0.
$$

This does not forbid structure. It forbids only divergence.

Closed electromagnetic configurations remain allowed.


# From a Rectangle to a Torus

Topologically, any finite surface can be represented as a rectangle.

If one pair of opposite edges is identified, the rectangle becomes a tube.
If the ends of the tube are identified, the result is a torus — a closed surface
with two independent holes.

< the two independent hole claim is super logical to me; topologists seem to
disagree. i think it is a matter of language. better to talk about the two independent incontractible loops, one per orthogonal direction of the torus>


# Standing Waves on a Torus

An electromagnetic field defined on a torus must satisfy global continuity
conditions.

Along each independent loop of the torus, the field must match itself after one
full traversal.

These conditions discretize the allowed configurations. The number of lines on
each of the orthogonal sides, when thought of as nodes of the standing wave show this.

Let $(m,n)$ denote the integer winding numbers along the two independent cycles
of the torus.

A standing electromagnetic wave on the torus is therefore characterized by an
ordered pair $(m,n)$.


# Energy and the Rydberg Structure

The total electromagnetic energy of the configuration is conserved.

As the number of windings increases, the surface is subdivided into more
regions, each carrying a smaller fraction of the total energy.

For symmetric configurations $m=n$, the energy per region scales as

$$
E_n = \frac{E_0}{n^2}.
$$

This reproduces the Rydberg series observed in atomic spectra.

Asymmetrical configurations $(m\neq n)$ naturally carry net circulation and
therefore electromagnetic moment.


# Charge as Topology

Because $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ everywhere, no radial electric field lines
originate from a point. This would be interpreted as "no charge".

All electromagnetic flow follows closed line; for example, a dipole.

Consider enclosing the toroidal configuration of energy $E_{m,n}$ within a
spherical surface of radius $r$ much larger than the torus itself.

As the enclosing surface grows, its area scales as $r^2$. The conserved
electromagnetic flow is therefore distributed over an area growing as $r^2$,
producing an effective $1/r^2$ dependence.

What is interpreted experimentally as a radial electric field produced by a
point charge is, in this description, the macroscopic imprint of a closed,
divergence-free electromagnetic circulation confined by topology.

Note that we are not following field lines, we are treating the torus as sort of
bulb with a light characterized by $(m,n)$. In this sense, the glow of such bulb
would decrease as $1/r^2$.

"Charge" can thus be changed by "topological charge", and acknowledge that we
have been measuring a $(m,n)$ energy density instead; an effective measure of
organized electromagnetic energy density, quantized by the winding numbers
$(m,n)$.
