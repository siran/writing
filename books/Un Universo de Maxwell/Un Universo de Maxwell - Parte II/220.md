### Self-Refraction and Electromagnetic Stability

In the preceding analysis of inertia, we treated a localized electromagnetic
configuration as a given—a bounded distribution of energy with total energy
$U$. We must now explain why such a configuration can exist at all, given the
well-known tendency of electromagnetic waves to disperse in free space.

In a Maxwell Universe, there is no container and no material substrate. There is
only the electromagnetic field itself. Any mechanism of confinement must
therefore arise from the field’s own dynamics. We call this mechanism
**self-refraction**.

#### Self-Generated Electromagnetic Environment

Refraction does not require matter; it requires a phase-delayed electromagnetic
response. In ordinary media, this response is attributed to bound charges. In a
Maxwell Universe, the response must instead arise from the field configuration
itself.

A self-sustained electromagnetic structure continuously generates secondary
electromagnetic fields through its internal dynamics. These secondary fields are
phase-delayed relative to the primary energy flow. An electromagnetic wave
propagating within such a configuration therefore propagates not through empty
space, but through an electromagnetic environment created by the configuration
itself.

The configuration thus acts as its own effective medium.

#### Energy Flow and Closure

The local flow of electromagnetic energy is described by the Poynting vector,

$$
\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\,\vec{E} \times \vec{B}.
$$

Stability requires that energy not escape to infinity. This condition is not
$\vec{S} = 0$, but rather **closure**:

$$
\oint_{\partial V} \vec{S}\cdot d\vec{A} = 0 .
$$

Inside the region $V$, energy continues to move. However, its flow is redirected
by the phase structure of the self-generated electromagnetic environment so that
it forms closed or recurrent paths. Energy circulates rather than radiates.

This closed circulation of energy is the precise meaning of electromagnetic
self-confinement.

#### Self-Refraction Without Modified Maxwell Equations

No modification of Maxwell’s equations is required. The equations remain linear
and source-free everywhere. The apparent bending of energy flow arises not from
nonlinearity, but from interference between primary fields and secondary,
phase-delayed fields generated by the configuration itself.

Equivalently, the redistribution of electromagnetic energy and momentum encoded
in the cross terms of the total field produces a spacetime-dependent structure
that continuously redirects propagation. Phase delay and energy redistribution
are two descriptions of the same process.

Self-refraction is therefore a consequence of **field–field interaction with
memory**, not of altered constitutive laws.

#### Topological Closure

Local closure of energy flow is not sufficient. For long-lived stability, the
closure condition must be satisfied globally. This imposes topological
constraints on the field configuration.

Configurations possessing non-contractible cycles—such as toroidal or knotted
structures—naturally support persistent circulation of electromagnetic energy.
Global continuity conditions force the field to reproduce itself after traversal
of closed paths, preventing decay through destructive interference.

The integers labeling these cycles are not imposed externally; they arise from
the requirement of self-consistent phase closure.

#### Stability as Identity

A self-sustained electromagnetic configuration persists because its own fields
generate the delayed response required to redirect subsequent propagation. The
configuration exists not despite dispersion, but because dispersion is exactly
balanced by self-refraction.

Matter, in this view, is not light trapped by an external medium.
Matter is electromagnetic energy whose own self-generated field structure
continuously refracts it into closed, self-consistent circulation.
