# the torus

one of the successes of quantum mechanics is to explain Hydrogen atoms energy levels with ultra-fine precision.

so, consider a standing electromagnetic wave on the surface of a torus, in a source-free Maxwell Universe, where all matter is considered electromagnetic.

because of continuity conditions
