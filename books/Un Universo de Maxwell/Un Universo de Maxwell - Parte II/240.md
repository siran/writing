## The Geometry of Existence

Having established that stability requires a closed circulation of energy, we
must now determine *which* specific configurations satisfy this requirement. The
universe does not produce particles of arbitrary mass and charge; it produces a
discrete spectrum. In a Maxwell Universe, this discreteness is not a quantum
postulate, but a topological necessity. We must therefore derive the "Selection
Rules" of existence from the geometry of the torus.


### 1. The Stability Hierarchy

We model the fundamental particle as a flux tube winding on a torus with
integers $(n,m)$. To identify the ground state—the electron—we must classify
these topologies by their stability against unraveling.

A knot is topologically stable only if it cannot be continuously deformed into a
simple loop (the unknot) or separated into disconnected parts (a link) without
severing field lines. We rank the simplest integer combinations:

* **The Unknots $(1, k)$ or $(k, 1)$:** Any configuration where one winding
  number is unity is topologically trivial. A loop winding $(1,3)$ can be
  untwisted into a simple circle. Such a structure possesses no topological
  barrier to contraction; it will shrink and dissipate into radiation. These
  cannot represent matter.

* **The Links $(k, k)$:** If $n$ and $m$ share a common factor (e.g., $(2,2)$),
  the field does not form a single continuous knot but rather multiple
  interlocking rings. A fundamental particle must be a single coherent entity.
  Therefore, coprime winding numbers are required.

* **The Trefoil Knot $(2,3)$:** This is the first integer combination that
  creates a **Prime Knot**. It creates a single, continuous flux tube that
  cannot be untied. It is the configuration of minimum complexity that possesses
  inherent topological stability.

Therefore, the electron is identified as the **$(2,3)$ Torus Knot** not by
arbitrary assignment, but because it is the geometric ground state of the
Maxwell vacuum.


### 2. Impedance as a Geometric Invariant

Why does this knot manifest the specific physical constants we observe,
specifically the fine structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$? This value can
be seen to arise arises from the **Characteristic Impedance** of the $(2,3)$
topology.

We treat the self-confined flux tube as a resonant transmission line. Its
impedance $Z$ is determined by the ratio of its effective inductance ($L$) to
its effective capacitance ($C$):

$$
Z_{\text{knot}} = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
$$

These circuit parameters are geometric properties derived from the winding
numbers:

* **Inductance ($L \propto m^2$):** Inductance measures the magnetic flux
  generated per unit current. The toroidal windings ($m=3$) form the dense
  magnetic core of the particle. The stored magnetic energy scales with the
  square of the winding density around the central axis.

* **Capacitance ($C \propto n^2$):** Capacitance measures the charge separation
  capacity. The poloidal windings ($n=2$) determine how the electric field
  projects into the external space. The effective surface area for interaction
  scales with the poloidal twist.

For the $(2,3)$ geometry, the knot forms a "High-$L$, Low-$C$" circuit. The
field lines are wound tightly into a dense magnetic spine ($m=3$) while
presenting a minimal electric profile ($n=2$). This creates a structure with a
very high internal impedance:

$$
Z_{\text{knot}} \approx 25,812 \, \Omega
$$

This value is the geometric invariant known as the **Quantum of Resistance**. In
a topological theory, it represents the impedance of a "single-turn" of
reality—the resistance of a fundamental flux quantum.


### 3. The Mirror of Stability

The stability of the particle is the result of the interaction between this high
internal impedance and the low impedance of the surrounding vacuum ($Z_0 \approx
377 \, \Omega$).

$$
\text{Mismatch Ratio} = \frac{Z_0}{Z_{\text{knot}}} \approx \frac{377}{25,812} \approx \frac{1}{68.5}
$$

Because $Z_{\text{knot}} \gg Z_0$, the boundary of the particle acts as a hard
reflector. Energy circulating inside the knot hits the vacuum interface and is
reflected back inward, unable to couple effectively to the "soft" vacuum.

The fine structure constant is simply this mismatch ratio, halved by the
requirement of **Equipartition**. A standing wave must confine two energy
components (electric and magnetic) simultaneously; thus, the effective barrier
is doubled:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{Z_0}{Z_{\text{knot}}} \right) \approx \frac{1}{137}
$$

The electron exists because it bounces off vacuum as if it were a mirror. Reminds of total internal reflection phenomenon.


### 4. The Spectral Signature: Koide’s Formula

If the electron is the ground state, the heavier leptons (Muon and Tau) are excited states of the same $(2,3)$ resonator. They share the same knot geometry but oscillate at higher harmonic frequencies.

Because the underlying geometry is fixed, the masses of the lepton family are constrained by a single geometric parameter: the **Safety Factor** of the knot.

$$
q = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{3}{2}
$$

This ratio governs the distribution of stress along the flux tube. Remarkably, the empirical masses of the leptons satisfy **Koide’s Formula**, which sums to a constant value of exactly $2/3$:

$$
\frac{m_e + m_\mu + m_\tau}{(\sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau})^2} \approx \frac{2}{3} = K
$$

We identify Koide’s constant $K$ as the inverse of the safety factor:

$$
K = \frac{n}{m}
$$

This relation is the "smoking gun" of topology. It indicates that the mass of the lepton family is not random. It is determined by the winding efficiency of the $(2,3)$ knot. The leptons are not three different particles; they are three resonance modes of a single topological object, tuned by the geometry of a trefoil.
