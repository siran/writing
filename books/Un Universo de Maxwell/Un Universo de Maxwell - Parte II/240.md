## The Geometry of Existence

Having established that stability requires a closed circulation of energy, we
must now determine *which* specific configurations satisfy this requirement. The
universe does not produce particles of arbitrary mass and charge; it produces a
discrete spectrum. In a Maxwell Universe, this discreteness is not a quantum
postulate, but a topological necessity. We must therefore derive the "Selection
Rules" of existence from the geometry of the torus.


### 1. The Stability Hierarchy

We model the fundamental particle as a flux tube winding on a torus with
integers $(n,m)$. To identify the ground state—the electron—we must classify
these topologies by their stability against unraveling.

A knot is topologically stable only if it cannot be continuously deformed into a
simple loop (the unknot) or separated into disconnected parts (a link) without
severing field lines. We rank the simplest integer combinations:

* **The Unknots $(1, k)$ or $(k, 1)$:** Any configuration where one winding
  number is unity is topologically trivial. A loop winding $(1,3)$ can be
  untwisted into a simple circle. Such a structure possesses no topological
  barrier to contraction; it will shrink and dissipate into radiation. These
  cannot represent stable matter.

* **The Links $(k, k)$:** If $n$ and $m$ share a common factor (e.g., $(2,2)$),
  the field does not form a single continuous knot but rather multiple
  interlocking rings. While these configurations may represent **composite bosons**
  (such as the photon, modeled as counter-propagating currents), they cannot
  represent a single elementary fermion. A fundamental particle must be a single
  coherent entity; therefore, coprime winding numbers are required.

* **The Trefoil Knot $(2,3)$:** This is the first integer combination that
  creates a **Prime Knot**. It creates a single, continuous flux tube that
  cannot be untied. It is the configuration of minimum complexity that possesses
  inherent topological stability.

Therefore, the electron is identified as the **$(2,3)$ Torus Knot** not by
arbitrary assignment, but because it is the geometric ground state of the
Maxwell vacuum.


### 2. Impedance as a Geometric Invariant

Why does this knot manifest the specific physical constants we observe,
specifically the fine structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$? This value
arises from the **Characteristic Impedance** of the $(2,3)$ topology.

We treat the self-confined flux tube as a resonant transmission line. Its
impedance $Z$ is determined by the ratio of its potential (Voltage) to its
flow (Current). In a field theory, these are defined by the fundamental flux
and charge quanta.

* **Voltage ($V$)** is the rate of change of Magnetic Flux ($\Phi$).
* **Current ($I$)** is the rate of change of Electric Charge ($Q$).
* **Impedance ($Z$)** is therefore the ratio of the total Flux to the total Charge:
  $$ Z = \frac{d\Phi}{dQ} \rightarrow \frac{\Phi_{\text{total}}}{Q_{\text{total}}} $$

For a fundamental topological object carrying exactly one unit of magnetic action
($h$) and one unit of electric charge ($e$), the total flux is the magnetic flux
quantum $\Phi_0 = h/e$. The impedance of the "single turn" of reality is thus:

$$
Z_{\text{knot}} = \frac{\Phi_0}{e} = \frac{h}{e^2} \approx 25,812 \, \Omega
$$

This value is the geometric invariant known as the **Quantum of Resistance**. It
represents the intrinsic impedance of a flux tube that is topologically unitary.

**Geometric Realization:**
This high impedance is physically realized by the $(2,3)$ geometry, which forms
a "High-$L$, Low-$C$" circuit. The field lines are wound tightly into a dense
magnetic spine ($m=3$, high Inductance) while presenting a minimal electric
profile ($n=2$, low Capacitance).


### 3. The Mirror of Stability

The stability of the particle is the result of the interaction between this high
internal impedance and the low impedance of the surrounding vacuum.

* **Vacuum Impedance ($Z_0$):** Defined by the constants of free space,
  $Z_0 = \sqrt{\mu_0/\epsilon_0} \approx 377 \, \Omega$.
* **Knot Impedance ($Z_{\text{knot}}$):** Defined by the topology,
  $Z_{\text{knot}} \approx 25,812 \, \Omega$.

$$
\text{Mismatch Ratio} = \frac{Z_0}{Z_{\text{knot}}} \approx \frac{377}{25,812} \approx \frac{1}{68.5}
$$

Because $Z_{\text{knot}} \gg Z_0$, the boundary of the particle acts as a hard
reflector. Energy circulating inside the knot hits the vacuum interface and is
reflected back inward, unable to couple effectively to the "soft" vacuum.
This is analogous to **Total Internal Reflection** in optics, where light trapped
in a dense medium (diamond) cannot escape into a rare medium (air).

The fine structure constant is simply this mismatch ratio, halved by the
requirement of **Equipartition**. A standing wave must confine two energy
components (electric and magnetic) simultaneously; thus, the effective barrier
is doubled:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{Z_0}{Z_{\text{knot}}} \right) \approx \frac{1}{137}
$$

The electron exists because it bounces off the vacuum as if it were a mirror.


### 4. The Spectral Signature: Koide’s Formula

If the electron is the ground state, the heavier leptons (Muon and Tau) are
excited states of the same $(2,3)$ resonator. They share the same knot geometry
but oscillate at higher harmonic frequencies (standing waves with more nodes
along the flux tube).

Because the underlying geometry is fixed, the masses of the lepton family are
constrained by a single geometric parameter: the **Safety Factor** of the knot.
This term, borrowed from plasma physics, describes the ratio of toroidal to
poloidal windings required to keep the field lines closed:

$$
q = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{3}{2}
$$

This ratio governs the distribution of stress along the flux tube. Remarkably,
the empirical masses of the leptons satisfy **Koide’s Formula**, which sums to a
constant value of exactly $2/3$:

$$
\frac{m_e + m_\mu + m_\tau}{(\sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau})^2} \approx \frac{2}{3} = K
$$

We identify Koide’s constant $K$ as the inverse of the safety factor:

$$
K = \frac{n}{m}
$$

This relation is the "smoking gun" of topology. It indicates that the mass of
the lepton family is not random. It is determined by the winding efficiency of
the $(2,3)$ knot. The leptons are not three different particles; they are three
resonance modes of a single topological object, tuned by the geometry of a
trefoil.
