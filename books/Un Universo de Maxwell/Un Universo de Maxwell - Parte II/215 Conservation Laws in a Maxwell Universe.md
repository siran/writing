### From Spectral Structure to Mechanics

In the preceding chapter, we showed that discrete spectral structure—exemplified
by the Rydberg series—arises naturally when electromagnetic fields are confined
by global continuity conditions. Discreteness emerged not from particles,
forces, or quantization rules, but from topology: the requirement that a field
defined on a compact configuration match itself after completing closed cycles.

At that stage, the discussion concerned only internal structure: how energy
redistributes within a self-confined electromagnetic configuration. Yet a
question remains unavoidable. If such configurations are to be identified with
ordinary matter, how do they move? How do they carry momentum, resist
acceleration, and obey the conservation laws that govern everyday mechanics?

The answer cannot be imported from Newtonian axioms or particle models, because
neither exists in a Maxwell Universe. If mechanics is to arise at all, it must
arise from electromagnetic field dynamics alone.

The purpose of the present chapter is to show that it does—inevitably.


## Conservation Laws in a Maxwell Universe

In a Maxwell Universe, the electromagnetic field is the only fundamental entity.
There are no particles, no intrinsic masses, and no independent mechanical
postulates. All physical objects are structured, self-confined electromagnetic
field configurations evolving according to the source-free Maxwell equations,

$$
\nabla\cdot\vec{E}=0,\qquad
\nabla\cdot\vec{B}=0,\qquad
\nabla\times\vec{E}=-\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t},\qquad
\nabla\times\vec{B}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t}.
$$

These four equations supply the entire dynamics. What we call “matter” is nothing
more than a persistent solution of these equations.


### Energy and Momentum Are Field Properties

Maxwell’s theory assigns energy and momentum directly to fields. The local
electromagnetic energy density is

$$
u=\tfrac12\bigl(\epsilon_0|\vec{E}|^2+\mu_0^{-1}|\vec{B}|^2\bigr),
$$

and the flow of this energy is given by the Poynting vector,

$$
\vec{S}=\mu_0^{-1}\,\vec{E}\times\vec{B}.
$$

Momentum is not an added concept; it is already present in the field. The
momentum density is

$$
\vec{g}=\frac{\vec{S}}{c^2}=\epsilon_0\,\vec{E}\times\vec{B}.
$$

For any localized electromagnetic configuration occupying a region $V$, the
total momentum is therefore

$$
\vec{P}=\int_V \vec{g}\,d^3x.
$$

No mass parameter has been introduced.


### Why Momentum Is Conserved

The conservation of momentum follows directly from Maxwell dynamics.
Differentiating the momentum density and using Maxwell’s equations yields the
local balance law

$$
\frac{\partial\vec{g}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{T}=0,
$$

where $\mathbf{T}$ is the Maxwell stress tensor,

$$
T_{ij}=\epsilon_0\!\left(E_iE_j+c^2B_iB_j
-\tfrac12\delta_{ij}(|\vec{E}|^2+c^2|\vec{B}|^2)\right).
$$

Integrating over a volume $V$ gives

$$
\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}
=-\!\int_{\partial V}\mathbf{T}\cdot d\vec{A}.
$$

Momentum changes only when electromagnetic stress crosses the boundary. For a
self-confined configuration whose external fields cancel on $\partial V$, the
surface integral vanishes and $\vec{P}$ remains constant.

Momentum conservation is therefore not a postulate, but a consequence of
source-free Maxwell dynamics.


### Inertia Without Mass

Define the total electromagnetic energy in $V$,

$$
U=\int_V u\,d^3x,
$$

and the center of energy,

$$
\vec{R}(t)=\frac{1}{U}\int_V \vec{r}\,u\,d^3x.
$$

Electromagnetic field theory gives the exact relation

$$
\vec{P}=U\,\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}.
$$

If $\vec{P}$ is constant, then $d\vec{R}/dt$ is constant. A localized
electromagnetic configuration therefore moves at uniform velocity unless acted
upon by external electromagnetic stress.

This is inertia.


### Angular Momentum and Rotation

Electromagnetic fields also carry angular momentum. The angular-momentum density
is

$$
\vec{\ell}=\vec{r}\times\vec{g},
$$

and the total angular momentum is

$$
\vec{L}=\int_V \vec{r}\times(\epsilon_0\,\vec{E}\times\vec{B})\,d^3x.
$$

Its evolution obeys

$$
\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}
=-\!\int_{\partial V}\vec{r}\times(\mathbf{T}\cdot d\vec{A}).
$$

Angular momentum is conserved whenever no torque crosses the boundary. A
self-confined electromagnetic configuration with internal circulation will
rotate indefinitely unless acted upon by an external stress.

Rotational inertia is the persistence of circulating field momentum.


### What a “Force” Is

In a Maxwell Universe, a force is not primitive. A push is simply an external
electromagnetic field overlapping a localized configuration. During the overlap,

$$
\vec{E}_{\text{tot}}=\vec{E}+\vec{E}_{\text{ext}},\qquad
\vec{B}_{\text{tot}}=\vec{B}+\vec{B}_{\text{ext}},
$$

and the momentum density becomes

$$
\vec{g}_{\text{tot}}=\epsilon_0\,\vec{E}_{\text{tot}}\times\vec{B}_{\text{tot}}.
$$

Momentum is redistributed through electromagnetic stress. After the interaction
ends, the configuration relaxes into a new steady state with a different total
momentum.


### Emergence of Newton’s Second Law

Define an effective inertial measure,

$$
m_{\text{eff}}=\frac{U}{c^2}.
$$

Since $\vec{P}=U\,\vec{v}$ with $\vec{v}=d\vec{R}/dt$, we have

$$
\vec{P}=m_{\text{eff}}\vec{v}.
$$

Differentiating and identifying stress-tensor flux as the external influence
yields

$$
\vec{F}_{\text{ext}}=m_{\text{eff}}\vec{a}.
$$

Newton’s second law is not fundamental. It is an identity expressing how
electromagnetic stress changes field momentum.


### What This Means

All classical mechanical behavior—translation, rotation, inertia, and
conservation laws—emerges directly from source-free Maxwell dynamics. No
particles, intrinsic masses, or auxiliary axioms are required.

In a Maxwell Universe, mechanics is not imposed on matter.
Mechanics is the natural behavior of structured electromagnetic fields.


### Topology, Energy, and Motion

The same global constraints that discretize the internal energy of a
self-confined electromagnetic configuration also govern its external behavior.

In the Rydberg analysis, standing-wave conditions on compact configurations
forced energy into discrete modes labeled by integers. These integers were not
introduced by hand; they were the unavoidable consequence of field continuity on
closed cycles.

Momentum and angular momentum arise from the same logic. They are not attributes
of particles, but integrals of electromagnetic energy flow. Their conservation is
not imposed as a principle; it follows from the absence of stress flux across the
boundary of a closed configuration.

Thus, spectral structure and mechanical behavior are not separate domains.
Quantized internal organization and classical motion are two aspects of the same
electromagnetic reality: globally constrained, source-free Maxwell fields.

Once matter is recognized as a self-sustained electromagnetic configuration, the
emergence of inertia and conservation laws is no longer surprising. It is the
only outcome consistent with Maxwell dynamics.


### Self-Refraction and Electromagnetic Stability

In a Maxwell Universe, refraction does not require matter. It requires only a
phase-delayed electromagnetic response. A propagating electromagnetic wave
experiences refraction whenever it traverses a region where additional
electromagnetic fields respond with temporal delay, producing a shifted phase
velocity through interference.

If matter itself is a self-sustained electromagnetic configuration, then such a
configuration necessarily constitutes a region of structured electromagnetic
response. A traveling wave entering this region propagates not through empty
space, but through a pre-existing field whose internal dynamics generate
secondary, phase-lagged electromagnetic fields. The configuration therefore
acts as an effective refractive structure.

In this sense, the “medium” responsible for refraction is not substance, but
field organization. The effective refractive index is determined not by material
composition, but by the strength and phase structure of the background
electromagnetic configuration.

When the refractive response is weak, incident electromagnetic energy is only
slightly deflected. When the response is strong and spatially structured, the
propagation direction can curve significantly. In the limiting case, the
deflection closes on itself: the electromagnetic field is continuously bent back
into a closed trajectory by its own phase-delayed response.

Stability then arises as self-refraction. The electromagnetic configuration
persists because its internal fields continuously generate the very refractive
structure required to confine their own propagation. Energy circulates along
closed paths not because it is trapped by an external container, but because the
field configuration itself supplies the delayed response that bends propagation
back inward.

Matter, in this view, is not light confined by matter. Matter is light whose
self-generated electromagnetic environment refracts it into a closed,
self-consistent orbit.
