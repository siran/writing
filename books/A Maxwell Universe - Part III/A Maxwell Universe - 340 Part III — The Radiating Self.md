# The Radiating Self

If the "Self" steers the body, and the body is an electrical machine, then the
"Self" does not stop at the skin. It radiates.


## The Body as an Antenna

The human body is a **Phased Array Dipole Emitter**.
* **The Heart:** A magnetic toroid generator ($\sim 50 \mu\text{A}$).
* **The Spine:** A linear transmission line ($\sim 1 \text{ m}$).
* **The Result:** We are continuously broadcasting our internal state into the
  vacuum.


## The Physics of Noise (The Crowd)

The standard critique of this theory is "Thermal Noise."
Physicists argue that at room temperature ($310\text{ K}$), the random vibration of atoms is orders of magnitude stronger than any biological field. They claim the signal is buried.

In a Maxwell Universe, **"Random" does not exist.** What we call "Thermal Noise"
is not entropy. It is **Signal Density.**
* The "Noise" of the vacuum is the superposition of the broadcasts of 8 billion
  other observers (and trillions of animals).
* We are not trying to broadcast into silence; we are trying to broadcast into a
  stadium.
* **Heat is Data.** The "Temperature" of the room is the sum of the Wills
  occupying it.


## The Collective Anchor (Why You Can't Fly)

This resolves the paradox of influence: If the Will is a force, why can't we
fly? We are not just fighting gravity (dielectric refraction); we are fighting
the **Impedance of the Consensus**.

To levitate, you must locally rewrite the probability field of the vacuum. But
you are immersed in a background field generated by 8 billion minds continuously
broadcasting the Imprint: *"Humans stay on the ground."*
* Your signal: $1$ Watt (The Exception).
* The Noise: $10^9$ Watts (The Rule).

This is why "Miracles" are rare. They require a localized signal intensity that
momentarily overpowers the thermal background of the Collective Consensus.


## Derivation of Influence (The Field Radius)

Even if we cannot fly, can we influence?
Calculating the electric field $E$ of a synchronized neural/heart pulse ($1 \text{ mA}$ at $10 \text{ Hz}$):
$$
E \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ V/m} \quad (\text{at } r=1\text{m})
$$

What does this field do? Previous calculations suggested it could drag a single
electron 360 meters in a vacuum. The critique is that in matter, the electron
hits an atom instantly. **The Rebuttal:** The electron does not need to travel
360 meters. The **Field** extends 360 meters.
* Within that sphere, **every single electron** feels the bias of your Will.
* You are not pushing one rock; you are applying a polarized bias to an ocean of
  charge.


## The Mechanism: Stochastic Resonance

How does a weak Will move a heavy World? Through **Stochastic Resonance**. We do
not overpower the noise. We **bias** it.
* A small, periodic nudge (The Individual Will) applied to a noisy system can
  steer the system's evolution over time.
* We do not "force" the glass to move. We tilt the probability field so that the
  "Random" vibrations of the universe statistically drift in our direction.


## The Phantom Experiment (Falsification)

We propose a test. **The Setup:** A Torsion Balance (ultra-sensitive mass) in a
vacuum. **The Subject:** A human (or mechanical phantom) broadcasting a coherent
10 Hz signal. **The Prediction:** The balance will not move linearly. It will
exhibit a **Biased Brownian Motion**. The "random" jitter of the balance will
statistically drift away from the source of the Will.
