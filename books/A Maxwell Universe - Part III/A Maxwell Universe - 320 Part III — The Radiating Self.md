# The Radiating Self

We have established that the "Self" is a **Causally Free** construct—a pattern
of information that steers the biological machine. We have established that the
machine itself is a system of **Maxwellian Knots** (matter) and currents.

This leads to a necessary physical consequence that has been historically
relegated to mysticism, but which is rigorously unavoidable in a Maxwell
Universe: **The Broadcast.**

If the "Self" determines the firing patterns of neurons and the rhythm of the
heart, and if those organs carry electrical currents, then the "Self" is not
confined to the body. It is continuously radiating outward into the vacuum.


## The Body as an Antenna

Standard neuroscience treats the brain as a closed processor. In a Maxwell
Universe, this is impossible.

1.  **The Axon:** A single neuron is a linear conductor carrying micro-amperes
    of ionic current.

2.  **The Heart:** The cardiac loop is a powerful rotating dipole carrying
    milli-amperes.

3.  **The Spine:** The central nervous system acts as a vertical transmission
    line.

When the "Self" makes a decision—when the Imprint overrides the substrate—it
orchestrates a synchronized firing of these circuits. From the perspective of
electromagnetism, this is not just "thought." **It is Antenna Theory.**

The human body is a phased array of biological dipoles. When we think or feel
intense emotion, we are modulating the current in these dipoles. By Maxwell's
laws, an accelerating charge *must* radiate energy.


## The Physics of Influence (Telempathy)

We calculated the field strength of this biological emission. At a distance of 1
meter, the low-frequency ($10$ Hz) oscillation generated by the brain-heart
coupling produces an electric field capable of displacing a free electron by
hundreds of meters in a vacuum.

This provides a strictly classical basis for connection, but it requires a
correction in terminology. It is often called "Telepathy," but a more precise
term is **Telempathy**.

> The receiver does not "read" the thought; they **resonate** with the state.
> The signal is amplified only if the receiver’s Imprint holds a compatible
> moral or emotional geometry. It is literally "feeling at a distance."


## The Physics of Will (Telekinesis)

More radically, this implies that the "Will" has a direct mechanical coupling to
external matter.

In the calculations, we showed that the field of the mind can displace a test
electron by hundreds of meters. This is not a "subtle" force in the usual sense.
It is massive on the quantum scale.

The Will does not push objects like a hand pushes a cup. It acts on the
**electronic infrastructure** of the object.

* Friction is just electron-electron bonding.

* Gravity is just dielectric refraction.

When the Mind pushes, it is not fighting these forces; it is **modulating**
them. It is rewriting the local electromagnetic boundary conditions. The "force"
is the realignment of the object's internal fields by the external broadcast.


## The Collective Anchor (The Physics of Consensus)

If the individual Will is this powerful, why can't we fly? Why don't cups float
when we wish them to?

The answer lies in the **Collective Broadcast.**

The universe is not empty. It is filled with the background flux of billions of
conscious observers. Each observer carries a deeply ingrained Imprint of "What
Is Possible.":
* "Humans fall."
* "Objects are heavy."
* "Space is empty."

This means that billions of biological antennas are continuously broadcasting a
coherent **Holding Signal**. The collective human species acts as a massive
signal jammer.

"Reality" as we experience it is the constructive interference of this
species-wide expectation. The laws of physics—at least the macroscopic limits we
perceive—are enforced by the electromagnetic consensus.

If I try to fly, I am not just fighting gravity (the dielectric gradient). I am
fighting the **Impedance of the Collective Mind**. My personal signal attempting
to rewrite the local field is drowned out by the billions of signals asserting
"You cannot fly."
