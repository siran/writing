# The Causally Free

In Part I, we established that we never touch the causal substrate of the
universe; we only interact with its effects. In Part II, we described the
physical world—matter, energy, light—as the direct, knotted topology of that
substrate. A proton is "causally bound"; it must obey Maxwell’s equations at
every point, continuously and locally.

Part III concerns the emergence of a second reality.

As causal loops stabilize, they produce *imprints* — internal records of the
loop's own history. These records (memories, symbols, ideas) possess a property
that matter does not: they are *causally free*.

They are "free" because they have detached from the physical constraints of the
substrate. They float above the energy flows that sustain them, obeying a new,
strange form of necessity: *acausal determinism*.


## The Meta-Layer

Consider the concept of a "circle."

A physical ring (a tire, a bubble) is causally bound. It acts on the air around
it; it responds to friction; it ages; it breaks. It interacts.

The *idea* of a circle is just an imprint of the loop, and only interacts with
it.

It is abstract, in that it only has the initial properties we abscribe to it. *A
priori*, and if convenient, it can have no mass, no charge, or no other
properties. However, it *is* a circle, so its area *has* to be $\pi r^2$,
because that is what a circle *is*.

The circle exists in this "platonic space", or imprints of the loop. It is a
"meta-layer" structure — a stable pattern of though that can be instantiated in
a mind, on paper, or in silicon, without ever being corrupted by the medium.
Being concerned mostly with the fundamentals of the problem, it is beyond of the
scope of this book to delve into specifics of how a thought is instantiated in
the brain, a paper, or else. We will, however, propose candidate mechanisms for
cognition, recognition, and perhaps others.

This layer of existence — the world of forms, laws, and mathematics — is the
realm of the *causally free*. It is a ghost world that rides atop the physical
world, effectively decoupled from the laws of mechanics, but *acausally
deterministic*, as we shall see.


## Acausal Determinism

If these ideas are free from physical laws, are they chaotic? No. They are
governed by another master: *logical necessity.*

This is the paradox of the meta-layer:

* The physical substrate is governed by causality, which gives rise to reality;
  as seen in Part I, state $s$ leads to state $s+1$.

* The meta-layer is governed by **implication** (axiom $A$ necessitates
  conclusion $B$).

This is *acausal determinism*: If you accept the axioms of Euclidean geometry
(the imprint), you *must* accept that the angles of a triangle sum to 180
degrees. This "must" is not a physical force. No electron is pushing you to
agree. It is a logical inevitability that exists outside of time and causality.

An "idea" is inert, intangible, and eternal. It just sits there, as an imprint
of a self-sustained causal loop. By virtue of its creation and maintenance by
the loop, the *idea* or *imprint* determines the evolutions of the loop.
