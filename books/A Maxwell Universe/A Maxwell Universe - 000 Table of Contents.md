## PART I — FOUNDATIONS OF REALITY

1. From Darkness, Light
   - Events as primitives
   - Operational awareness and causal loops

2. Time
   - Time as emergent ordering
   - Reconstruction of the past
   - Consensus and fragility of interpretation

3. Orderings
   - Causal steps and chains
   - Loops as clocks
   - Self-sustaining loops as noticers

4. Counting Steps
   - Duration as step counting
   - Distance from minimal causal chains
   - Emergent geometry via embeddings
   - Dimension as a relational property

5. Space
   - One-dimensionality of causal distance
   - Full distance set as emergent space
   - Structure from compression, not substrate

6. Plato and the Cave
   - Shadows vs. underlying structure
   - Limits of inference
   - Patterns as the only accessible reality


## PART II — THE POINT-MASS PATH

5A. Newtonian Lineage: Newton → Ether → Michelson–Morley → SR/GR → Quantum
patches

5B. Fragmentation: mechanics, relativity, quantum split into branches
