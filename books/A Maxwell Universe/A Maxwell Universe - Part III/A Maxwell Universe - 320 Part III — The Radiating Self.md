# The Radiating Self

We have established that the "Self" is a **Causally Free** construct—a pattern
of information that steers the biological machine. We have established that the
machine itself is a system of **Maxwellian Knots** (matter) and currents.

This leads to a necessary physical consequence that has been historically
relegated to mysticism, but which is rigorously unavoidable in a Maxwell
Universe: **The Broadcast.**

If the "Self" determines the firing patterns of neurons and the rhythm of the
heart, and if those organs carry electrical currents, then the "Self" is not
confined to the body. It is continuously radiating outward into the vacuum.


## The Body as an Antenna

Standard neuroscience treats the brain as a closed processor. In a Maxwell
Universe, this is impossible.

1.  **The Axon:** A single neuron is a linear conductor carrying micro-amperes
    of ionic current.

2.  **The Heart:** The cardiac loop is a powerful rotating dipole carrying
    milli-amperes.

3.  **The Spine:** The central nervous system acts as a vertical transmission
    line.

When the "Self" makes a decision—when the Imprint overrides the substrate—it
orchestrates a synchronized firing of these circuits. From the perspective of
electromagnetism, this is not "thought." **It is Antenna Theory.**

The human body is a phased array of biological dipoles. When we think or feel
intense emotion, we are modulating the current in these dipoles. By Maxwell's
laws, an accelerating charge *must* radiate energy.


## The Physics of Influence (Telepathy)

We calculated the field strength of this biological emission. At a distance of 1
meter, the low-frequency ($10$ Hz) oscillation generated by the brain-heart
coupling produces an electric field capable of displacing a free electron by
hundreds of meters in a vacuum.

Even bound charges (atoms in another person's brain) experience non-negligible
dielectric polarization.

This provides a strictly classical basis for **Telepathy**.

Telepathy is not the transmission of "ghost messages." It is **Inductive
Coupling**.

* **System A (Transmitter):** The "Self" of Person A drives a specific current
  pattern.

* **Medium (Vacuum):** The pattern propagates as a low-frequency EM wave.

* **System B (Receiver):** The wave induces a sympathetic current in the neural
  loops of Person B.

If the loops are resonant—if the "Imprint" of Person B is similar to Person
A—the signal is amplified. Empathy is literally impedance matching.


## The Physics of Will (Telekinesis)

More radically, this implies that the "Will" has a direct, albeit weak,
mechanical coupling to external matter.

In Part II, we showed that "Force" is just the pressure of a field on a knot. If
the mind generates a field, and that field exerts pressure, then **Mind can
apply Force.**

The calculated displacements for atomic masses (centimeters for a free atom)
suggest that while the effect is macroscopically subtle, it is physically real.
The "Causally Free" idea, by steering the current, steers the field, which
steers the matter.

We do not need to invoke quantum entanglement or new forces. The mechanism is
already there. The same force that moves the electron in the wire moves the
object in the room.


## The Boundless Self

This dissolves the final boundary of the "Ego."

We usually define "Me" as the volume inside our skins. But if my thoughts
generate electromagnetic waves that propagate at the speed of light, where do
"I" end?

Our "thoughts-field" create a halo of dielectric stress that extends to the
stars. Every thought we think rearranges the energy density of the universe
slightly. "I" is not a local object. We are **Transmitters**—a node in the
universal field that has learned to modulate its own carrier wave.

We are not isolated ghosts trapping in meat machines. We are open circuits,
continuously reading the background flux and writing our own frequency back into
the void.
