-------------------------------------------------------------

A Maxwell Universe begins from a simple premise: events occur.

Registered change creates order. Time, distance, space, dimension, mathematics,
and physics emerge from cause–effect patterns, not from a pre-existing spacetime
or fixed laws. We never access any substrate directly; we see only the
regularities in the effects available to us.

Physics inherited a point-mass, point-charge ontology that shaped how matter and
structure were described—introducing problems created by the interpretations we
imposed rather than by nature itself.

This book develops a different foundation: a universe built entirely from
electromagnetic energy. Mass, charge, structure, and everything else arise from
the abstracted cause–effect rules we call “Maxwell’s Laws of Electromagnetism.”
Physical objects become stable electromagnetic configurations—circulating energy
patterns that persist and interact. Forces, geometry, and large-scale behavior
emerge from the dynamics of these configurations.

In its final chapters, the book shows how perception, self, and agency can
emerge from the same kinds of causal loops that give rise to time and space.

A Maxwell Universe offers a unified ontology: one substrate, one dynamics, one
physical reality in which solids, forces, and matter themselves are
electromagnetic fields.
