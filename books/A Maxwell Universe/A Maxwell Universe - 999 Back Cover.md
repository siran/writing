A Maxwell Universe begins from a simple premise: events occur.

Registered change creates order. Time, distance, space, dimension, mathematics,
and physical laws emerge from cause–effect patterns, not from a pre-existing
spacetime or fixed rules. We never access any substrate directly; we see only
the regularities in the effects available to us.

Physics inherited a point-mass, point-charge ontology that shaped how matter and
structure were described—creating problems that came from our interpretations,
not from nature itself.

This book develops a different foundation: a universe built entirely from
electromagnetic energy. Mass, charge, and structure arise from the cause–effect
relations encoded in Maxwell’s laws. Physical objects are stable electromagnetic
configurations—circulating energy patterns that persist and interact. Forces,
geometry, and large-scale behavior emerge from the dynamics of these patterns.

In its final chapters, the book shows how perception, self, and agency can
emerge from the same kinds of causal loops that give rise to time and space.

A Maxwell Universe offers a unified ontology: one substrate, one dynamics, one
physical reality in which matter, forces, and solids are electromagnetic fields.
