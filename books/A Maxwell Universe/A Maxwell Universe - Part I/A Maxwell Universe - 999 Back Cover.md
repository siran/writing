A Maxwell Universe begins from a single premise: events occur.

Registered change creates order. From cause–effect relations alone emerge time,
distance, space, dimension, mathematics, and physical law. No spacetime is
assumed. No fixed rules are imposed. The underlying substrate, if any, is never
accessed directly—only the regularities in its effects are observed and
compressed into models.

The first part of A Maxwell Universe establishes this foundation. It prepares
the ground for later volumes, where matter, mass, and charge appear not as
fundamental point-entities, but as extended, self-sustaining electromagnetic
configurations governed entirely by Maxwell dynamics.
