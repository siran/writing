Part I develops a framework in which events are the starting point. A registered
change creates the basic distinction between “before” and “after.” Systems that
update their state in response to influences build internal orderings, and from
these orderings time emerges.

Causal steps link events into chains, and then loops. Loops support recurrent
patterns and can act as clocks. Counting causal steps gives duration and also
distance: the minimal number of steps between two events. Collecting all
pairwise distances produces an effective geometry.

Space and dimension arise when these distances can be embedded with low
distortion into a space of some dimension. Multiple embeddings imply non-unique
dimension; failure of all embeddings implies that geometry does not apply. Space
and dimension are therefore relational constructs, not fundamental ingredients
of reality.

The same compression mechanism explains arithmetic and mathematical laws. Stable
patterns become symbolic rules; when the patterns shift, the rules shift with
them. Mathematics succeeds where reality presents regularities, and fails where
it does not.

Across Part I, a single theme recurs: we do not access the underlying causal
structure itself. We access only its effects, and from these we construct
representations that remain valid only while the observed patterns stay stable.
