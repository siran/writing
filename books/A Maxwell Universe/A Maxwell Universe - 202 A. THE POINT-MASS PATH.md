## Geometry Before and the Point-Mass

### The ancients

Geometry is ancient. Long before physics existed as a discipline, geometric
relationships were studied as ideal objects: perfect lines, circles, and
proportions. By the time of Euclid (~300 BCE), geometry had become a formal
deductive system: abstract, exact, and independent of the physical world's
imperfections.

Even today we still debate whether numbers “exist,” or whether a perfect circle
is real or only an idea.


### Plato

Plato considered geometry to exist in a “higher realm,” with the physical world
only approximating its purity. As he wrote, “the objects of geometry are eternal
and unchanging” (*Republic* 510d–511a), and the visible world contains only
“images and shadows of the true” (*Republic* 596a). Whether an idea is “real” we
cannot prove, but we can certainly approximate these ideas using events.

Humans routinely identify geometric patterns in random stimuli; this is well
documented in Gestalt psychology, which shows our strong bias to impose simple
geometric structure on ambiguous input (Wagemans et al., *Annual Review of
Psychology*, 2012).

For Plato, geometry belonged to a realm more real than the material world.
Physical objects were degraded projections of perfect mathematical relations. In
this view, geometry is not derived from the world; the world participates in
geometry.


### Descartes

Descartes accepted the ancient notion of geometry as an abstract structure, but
introduced a powerful new tool: the idea of coordinate systems that allowed
geometry to be expressed symbolically and manipulated algebraically. A curve
could now be described by an equation; geometry translated into numbers.

For example:


> A circle of radius \(r\) centered at the origin is described by \(x^2 + y^2 =
> r^2\).


This transformation unified algebra and geometry.

On the matter of “what space is?”, Descartes did **not** propose a
container-like space. That idea came later. For Descartes, there is no empty
void. “The extension in length, breadth, and depth which constitutes the nature
of a body is the same as that which constitutes the nature of space”
(*Principles of Philosophy*, II, §10), and therefore “there can be no such thing
as a vacuum” (*Principles*, II, §16).

Geometry, for Descartes, describes extension itself rather than a background
that exists even when bodies do not.


### Newton

A major conceptual shift arrives with Newton. His goal was clear: to calculate
the motion of planets, stars, and falling bodies. To do this he focused only on
what mattered, and treated material bodies as points [^CowJoke].

[^CowJoke]: Any physicist knows that a burping point, circle, or sphere are all very good approximations of a cow.

This was never presented as a claim that matter is literally structureless.
Newton explicitly says it is *convenient* to consider bodies as mathematical
points (Principia, Book I, Lemma I), not that they are points in reality. He
also believed matter had internal parts, but lacked a theory of that structure.
His priority was prediction, not ontology.

To encode gravitational influence, Newton introduced absolute space and time: a
uniform background against which motion could be measured. In this framework,
forces acted at a distance, instantaneously and without a known mechanism. It
worked, and spectacularly so. The motions of the heavens matched the equations.

This move replaced the relational geometry of Descartes and the abstraction of
Euclid with a physical stage on which events unfold. It marked a profound shift
in worldview, yet was driven by calculation, not philosophical assertion.

From Newton, physics inherited an intuition: things are *objects* with definite
positions. Forces act on them, and their trajectories follow from these forces.
This intuition became the seed of the point-mass and later the point-charge
model; curiously each one of a distinct and non-interacting substances or
properties.

Over time, the abstraction hardened into ontology. The map replaced the
territory. Self-energy problems, action-at-a-distance, and the conceptual
puzzles of quantum collapse all trace back to this inherited idealizations:
point charges and point masses -- not to Newton’s intent, but to the assumption
that the point is fundamentally "real" (or, if not, why waste time discussing or
puzzzling about "singularities", point-wave dualities, that appear on our
incomplete theories).

As experiments grew more precise, the absence of a physical medium became
problematic. Waves require a substrate, so an ether was proposed: a stationary,
yet undetectable, medium for electromagnetic propagation.


### Michelson–Morley

Michelson–Morley exposed the contradiction. If light propagated through an
ether, motion relative to that medium should be detectable. It turned out that
the interpretation of their results -- much lower than expectected, so, "light
propagagtes in vacuum" idea.

Einstein replaced the not-found "ether" with spacetime geometry. Special
Relativity made the speed of light invariant; General Relativity encoded gravity
as curvature generated by a point-mass. These worked, but the ontology of “mass
points in a curved manifold” retained the original assumption: matter as
discrete localized entities.


## Schrödinger

Quantum theory fractured the picture further. The earliest hints came not from
Schrödinger, but from Planck (1900), who introduced quantized energy to explain
black-body radiation—an act of desperation, not conviction [^GoodIdea]. Einstein
(1905) then applied the idea to light itself, proposing that electromagnetic
waves sometimes behave as discrete packets. Neither Planck nor Einstein offered
a new ontology. Both were patching classical physics.

[^GoodIdea]: Turned out to be one of those good results from the what-if
reasoning.

It was Schrödinger (1926) who attempted to construct a coherent mechanics.
Inspired by de Broglie’s hypothesis that matter has an associated wavelengths,
he introduced a continuous wavefunction $\psi$ evolving by a differential
equation: the Schrödinger equation. Schrödinger’s intent was explicit: he
believed this wave was a real physical field, not a probability amplitude, and
expected classical structure to emerge from a smooth electromagnetic-like
medium.

But this interpretation clashed with experiments. Electrons arrived one at a
time on screens; atoms emitted discrete lines; detectors clicked individually.
To preserve the point-particle intuition inherited from Newton, Born proposed a
reinterpretation: $|\psi|^2$ is not a physical wave, but a probability
distribution. Instantly, the theory gained two incompatible rules:

1. smooth, deterministic evolution of $\psi$
2. abrupt, non-dynamical “collapse” upon measurement.

The wave was continuous; the outcomes were discrete.

Particles became both points *and* waves, depending on the experiment, and in a
not so understood way. So-called "collapse" became a special rule added by hand.
Fields were introduced but still quantized as point-like excitations. Layer
after layer of reinterpretation accumulated to preserve the underlying
assumption: matter is fundamentally discrete and localized, even when the
equations describing it are not.

Quantum theory thus deepened, rather than resolved, the tension introduced by
the point-mass ontology: smooth evolution mixed with instantaneous jumps,
continuity mixed with discreteness, waves mixed with points.
