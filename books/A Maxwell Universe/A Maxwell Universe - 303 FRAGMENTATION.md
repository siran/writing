## Point-structures

The point-mass framework, extended by patches rather than replaced, produced a
physics divided against itself. Each major theory preserved part of the
Newtonian intuition while abandoning other parts, resulting in a set of mutually
incompatible descriptions of the world.


### Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics kept Newton’s ontology intact: point-masses with definite
positions, evolving in absolute space and time under continuous forces. This
picture works for planets, projectiles, and engineering, but fails for atoms,
radiation, and high velocities. It assumes trajectories exist, even when no
experiment can reveal them.


### Relativity

Relativity retained point-masses but discarded absolute space and absolute time.
Space and time became a single geometric structure, and gravity became
curvature. The ontology shifted: fields replaced forces, geometry replaced
background, but the particle remained a localized entity following a path in
spacetime.

Relativity cannot accommodate discrete jumps or probabilistic outcomes. Its
equations describe smooth, differentiable fields everywhere.


### Quantum Theory

Quantum theory abandoned definite positions but kept discreteness. A particle is
sometimes a point, sometimes a wave, depending on the experiment. Its evolution
is continuous until a measurement, at which point it “collapses” to a location.
Two incompatible rules govern the same entity.

Trajectories do not exist. Observables do not have definite values. The theory
succeeds in prediction but not in ontology.


### Quantum Field Theory

Quantum Field Theory keeps relativity’s spacetime and quantum theory’s
probability amplitudes, but restores particles through quantized excitations of
fields. These excitations are treated as point-like for interactions. The
self-energy divergences that arise from point-like excitations require
renormalization — a successful mathematical procedure with no agreed physical
interpretation.

QFT unifies interactions mathematically, not ontologically. Locality, causality,
and discreteness coexist under tension.


### The Resulting Split

- Classical mechanics assumes continuous trajectories.
- Relativity assumes smooth fields and geometric background.
- Quantum mechanics assumes probabilistic non-trajectory behavior.
- QFT assumes point-like excitations of continuous fields.

Each branch preserves one incompatible piece of the Newtonian heritage:
localization, smoothness, continuity, discreteness. None of them can be true
together in the same ontology.

This is the fragmentation produced by preserving the point-mass intuition:
multiple theories, each accurate in its domain, none capable of describing
reality as a unified whole.

The patches worked. The ontology did not.
