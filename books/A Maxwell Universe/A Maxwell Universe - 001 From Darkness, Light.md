Reality begins not with space or time, but with the simple fact that events
happen.

We often assume events happen for a reason. They do not need to. A reason is a
story added later. What matters is simply that a change occurs and can be
registered. Once a change is registered, two states can be distinguished:
“before” and “after.” That distinction *is* the event.

The sense of reason or explanation arises only as a reactive story—a way of
organizing transitions once change has been noticed. Nothing deeper is assumed.

Here “awareness” does not refer to intelligence. It denotes only the minimal
capacity to register change.

This reactivity is not limited to conscious minds. Anything that changes in
response to causes and produces effects is, in this minimal sense,
**operationally aware**. A self-sustaining causal loop qualifies: it updates its
own state in response to incoming influences. By doing so, it distinguishes
states and tracks transitions. In this minimal operational sense, it “notices”
change.


## Time

Time is a construct: a tool awareness uses to organize its state. Each mind
forms its own internal notion of time. Yet we maintain collective agreements:
certain event-patterns (“causes”) tend to precede others (“effects”). Those who
do not share the prevailing interpretation are often labeled “irrational,”
though this only reflects different mappings between change and order.

We may picture “reality” [^WhatIsReality?] as a Node with an unknowable internal
structure [^Uncomputable]. All we know is that this structure reproduces
patterns of transitions from which we infer “before” and “after.”

What we call the past is reconstructed now, from present evidence. If new
evidence appears, our reconstruction may shift. The long debate about whether
dietary fat was harmful or beneficial is a familiar example later shown to rest
on selective data [^FatDebate]. Consensus reality is fragile. Without external
anchors, interpretations feel arbitrary, raising the persistent question: what
is real?


## Orderings

From the primitive relation

$$ n_i \succ n_j, $$

meaning “subnode $n_i$ causes $n_j$,” an ordering arises: before and after. We
may call this succession of events $i$ and $j$ a "causal step".

A series of events is a causal chain: i a b c d j.

Chains can form loops, ... j i a b c j i ... which are allowed to cross
themselves -- why not? -- until the loop is considered closed, in some useful
sense.

Repeated causal loops can function as clocks. Any recurrent sequence can serve
as a clock. Accuracy varies, but recurrence suffices.

Note that an effect that doesn't itself produce a cause is the end of a causal
chain. Its existence can't be noticed, by definition. So the fact that we notice
things, means that at least things (including us, in a sense) are, in essence,
self-sustaining causal loops.


## Counting steps

By counting loops or causal steps, awareness defines durations. Time is an
emergent count, not an external parameter.

Distance emerges by tracking how many causal steps connect two subnodes. If a
signal travels from $n_i$ to $n_j$ through a minimal chain of length $L_{ij}$,
then

$$
d(n_i, n_j) \propto L_{ij}.
$$

If no path exists, distance is infinite or undefined. If the only path returns
to the same subnode, the round-trip count is an effective measure of separation.
Distance is not a spatial coordinate but an operational measure of causal
separation.

In the companion work *Dimension and Space as Emergent Properties of Distance in
a Cause-Effect Model of the Emergence of Time*, these causal distances define an
effective geometry. Observers attempt to embed subsets of subnodes into
Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^D$ such that Euclidean distances approximate causal
distances:

$$ \|\Phi(n_i) - \Phi(n_j)\| \approx d(n_i, n_j). $$

When such embeddings succeed with low distortion, observers perceive a
$D$-dimensional space. If multiple embeddings work, dimension is not unique. If
none succeed, geometry fails. Space and dimension are not fundamental. They
emerge from how awareness compresses relational patterns.

What we call geometry, space, time, and distance arises only after awareness
notices repeated causal patterns and organizes them into stable expectations.
Underneath is a flux of interactions in darkness. Noticing shapes a world.


### Space

Distance is always one-dimensional: a single count of causal steps between two
events. What we call space is the union of all such distances. By collecting
every pairwise separation into one structure, awareness tries to form a coherent
geometric picture.

If the full set of distances can be embedded with low distortion into some
$\mathbb{R}^D$, we say the Node appears $D$-dimensional. If it cannot, the
resulting “space” may have no consistent dimension at all.

Structure is therefore emergent. If a set of events fits a “square embedding,”
observers perceive a square. The same pattern might be interpreted as a point, a
surface, or a thin slice of a volume. Structure depends on how relational
patterns are compressed, not on an intrinsic geometry underneath.


### Plato and the Cave

Plato illustrated the limits of our access to reality. We see shadows, not the
source. Our interpretations are reconstructions shaped by limited observation.
There is no external vantage point from which the true structure can be viewed.
We infer what we can from patterns alone.

[^WhatIsReality?]: Reality—“all that is”—includes everything you can think of
and everything you suspect exists but do not consciously consider. Any formal
definition is partial.

[^Uncomputable]: As in Plato’s cave: the underlying structure is inaccessible in
principle. We see only shadows and name some “causes” and others “effects.”

[^FatDebate]: Late-20th-century nutrition science framed fat as the main cause of
heart disease, but later reviews showed selective reporting and industry
influence. Contradictory data had been minimized. Re-analysis revealed a weaker
link than claimed, showing how consensus can form around distorted evidence.


### Energy Density

Within the Node, subnodes interact. These interactions are the only primitives.
When awareness notices that one transition reliably precedes another, we call
the first a “cause” and the second an “effect.” Nothing is “in space.” Nothing
“ticks” in time. Only relational influence exists.

The speed at which a cause produces an effect is what we call the speed of
light. Nothing can exceed it because it is a relational bound, not a moving
object’s velocity.

As a preview for later chapters, this fundamental cause–effect speed $c_0$ has
no requirement to be uniform everywhere [^FundamentalC]. Things may happen
faster or slower in different regions of the Node. Maxwell’s equations already
show that wave speed depends on energy density, as in a dielectric. Further
details come later.

[^FundamentalC]: If certain subnodes behave according to Maxwell’s equations,
the effective propagation speed depends on local energy density. Written plainly,
this is unsurprising: energy alters how fast things happen.
