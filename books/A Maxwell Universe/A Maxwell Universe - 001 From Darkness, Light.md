## Call

- First dakrness
- Awareness identifies the effects of causes.
- Awareness identified an ever present and continuous process, and to make sense
  of it the idea of time emerged, even the idea of cause and effect itself.
- Making sense of the world make us think that "some states" are the reason the
  system, or Node, changes to another state. The point is, that we don't have
  access to knowing the true causes of effects, and thus, even "causes" leading
  to "effects" has no real reason-to-be, other than it seems to be, we see it
  beeing.


## Response

### From Darkness, Light

- From darkness, only the witnessing is certain.
- What we call “cause” is a story awareness tells to track change.
- What we call “time” is the ordering of these stories: before, after, again.
- Reality does not reveal its reasons; it only reveals how things are, and from
  those we infer patterns.
- We name some patterns “causes” and others “effects”, but the naming is ours.
- All that is given is an ever-present flux of change and the fact that it can
  be noticed. Change seems to imply energy flux, movement, or "flow".
- From that noticing, time appears; from time, causality; from causality, a
  world.

Reality begins not with space or time, but with the notion that things happen.

We think things happen for a reason. It doesn't have to be like this
particularly, or in any other way. The way things seem to be, is just that, a
construct or story awareness constructs to make sense of events. It is probably
safe to think that awareness might think it has needs, and thus, that assigning
an ordering to event patterns, would help fulfill this them.

And so, time is a useful construct, an invention or tool, that awareness might
find useful in shaping its state, but not real in the absolute sense, but an
idea, particular to every mind. We obviously have general agreements in which
event-patters, that we call causes, produce another set of event-patterns, that
we call effects.

We can think of "reality" [^WhatIsReality?] as a "node" with a perhaps "unknown" [^Uncomputable]
or unknowable internal structure. All that we know is that it reproduces, time
and again, in a repeatable manner, groups of events that allow us to abstract an
ordering of "before" and "after".

Notice that what we call the past is reconstructed from evidence gathered in the
present moment. If we find new evidence then the past can completely change (fat
is good vs fat is bad debate comes to mind).

Structure is as well emergent. If a series of event are connected in a way that
an "square embedding" makes "sense', then it has a square geometry. Notice as
well that the same square can be thought of as a point, as an area, as a thin
slice of a volume. So, structure as well only exist in our minds, and it is not
an inherent property of what we perceive.

Either way, Plato made sure to illuminate, so to speak, the cave, and our
understanding of the innaproachability of "reality" by the usual ways that at
least Plato envisioned.

[^WhatIsReality?]: Whatever you want to call reality. There are also a couple of dictionary definitions that might help.

[^Uncomputable]: This is in allegory to Plato's cave allegory, in which reality in unnatainable in principle; we only see the shadows (sets of shadows that we call "causes", and other "effects")


### Light

Within reality, a "Node", subnodes interact. These interactions — if they occur
— are the only primitives. When awareness recognizes that one change reliably
precedes another, we name the first a “cause” and the second an “effect.” No
deeper structure is assumed. Nothing yet is “happening in space,” nothing yet
ticks in time. Only relational influence. The "speed" (so to speak, since we
haven't talked about distance, yet) at which a cause has an effect, is what we
call light speed.

That is the reason why nothing can go faster than light". However, as we discuss
later on, the fundamental speed of light, $c_0$, is not the same everywhere.
Things might happen "faster" here rather that there.

The reasons is "energy density", as Maxwell explains. But we are getting ahead
of ourselves. Sorry about that.


### Orderings

From a primitive relation $$ n_i \succ n_j $$ meaning “subnode \(n_i\) causes
\(n_j\),” an emergent ordering arises — a before and after.

We use repeated causal loops as clocks. This is obious in any recurrent tic-toc
of a clock. A clock can be construed in a multitude of ways, ones one "more
accurate" than others.

By counting these loops or causal steps, awareness defines durations. Time, in
this view, is not an external parameter but an emergent count.

Distance likewise emerges when one tracks how many causal steps connect one
subnode to another. If a signal travels from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\) through a
minimal chain of length \(L_{ij}\), we set

$$
d(n_i, n_j) \propto L_{ij}.
$$

If no such path exists, the “distance” is undefined or infinite. If the only
accessible path is a loop back to the same subnode, the round-trip count defines
an effective separation or duration. In this way “distance” is not a
pre-existing spatial coordinate, but a derived, operational measure of causal
separation.

In the companion work **Dimension and Space as Emergent Properties of Distance in a Cause-Effect Model of the Emergence of Time**, these causal distances become the basis for constructing an effective geometry. Observers attempt to embed subsets of subnodes into Euclidean spaces \(\mathbb{R}^D\) in such a way that the embedding distances approximate the causal distances:
$$ \bigl\|\Phi(n_i) - \Phi(n_j)\bigr\| \approx d(n_i, n_j). $$
When such an embedding succeeds with low distortion, the observer perceives a
\(D\)-dimensional space. If different embeddings yield different dimensions — or
if embedding fails — then dimension and geometry remain undetermined. Thus,
space and dimension are not fundamental features of the Node; they are emergent,
observer-dependent reconstructions of relational patterns.

What we call “geometry,” “space,” “time,” even “distance,” are not given. They
arise only after awareness encounters repeated causal patterns and chooses to
compress them into familiar forms. The underlying reality is a flux of
interactions in darkness. Only through noticing do we conjure a world.
