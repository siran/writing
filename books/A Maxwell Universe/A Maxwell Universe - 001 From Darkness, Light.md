## Call

- First darkness.
- Awareness identifies the effects of causes.
- Awareness identifies an ever-present and continuous process, and to make sense
  of it the idea of time emerges — even the idea of cause and effect itself.
- Making sense of the world makes us think that “some states” are the reason the
  system, or Node, changes into another state. The point is: we do not have
  access to the true causes of effects. Even “causes” leading to “effects” have
  no guaranteed reason-to-be other than that they *seem* to be. We see it
  happening.


## Response

### From Darkness, Light

- From darkness, only the witnessing is certain.
- What we call “cause” is a story awareness tells to track change.
- What we call “time” is the ordering of these stories: before, after, again.
- Reality does not reveal its reasons; it only reveals how things appear, and
  from those appearances we infer patterns.
- We name some patterns “causes” and others “effects,” but the naming is ours.
- All that is given is an ever-present flux of change and the fact that it can
  be noticed. Change seems to imply energy flux, movement, or “flow.”
- From that noticing, time appears; from time, causality; from causality, what
  *we* call reality.

Reality begins not with space or time, but with the notion that “events”
*happen*.

We assume things happen for a reason. They do not *need* to — not in any
fundamental sense. The way things appear is simply the interpretive story that
awareness constructs to make sense of events. It is reasonable to imagine that
awareness behaves as if it has needs, and that assigning an ordering to event
patterns helps fulfill these.

By “awareness,” we do **not** refer to intelligence. Only the primitive noticing
of change.


### Time

Time is a useful construct — an invention or tool that awareness uses to shape
its state. It is not real in an absolute sense. Each mind forms its own internal
notion of time. Yet we do have collective agreements: certain event-patterns
(“causes”) tend to precede others (“effects”). Those who do not share
consensus-reality are often labeled “unfit” or “irrational.”

We may picture “reality” [^WhatIsReality?] as a “Node” with an “unknown” or
unknowable internal structure [^Uncomputable]. All we know is that this
structure reproduces — repeatedly and consistently — groups of events from which
we infer an ordering of “before” and “after.”

Notice that what we call “the past” is reconstructed *now*, from evidence
available in the present. If new evidence appears, the past can change
completely. A familiar example is the long, confused debate in the late 20th
century about whether “fat is good” or “fat is bad,” a controversy later exposed
as a scientific scandal [^FatDebate]. Consensus reality is fragile. Without a
peer to confirm our interpretations, events feel arbitrary. Hence the persistent
question: *what is real?*


### Space

Distance also emerges from our handling of events. Events do not need to be
separate in a physical sense; there can simply be many causal steps between
them. Distance is the count of steps.

Structure is emergent as well. If a series of events are connected in a way that
a “square embedding” makes sense to consensus-reality, then we perceive that
structure as square. The same square may also be seen as a point, as an area, or
as a thin slice of a larger volume. Structure, like time, exists only in our
minds. It is not an inherent property of whatever underlies our perceptions.


### Plato and the Cave

Plato illuminated — metaphorically — the limits of our access to reality. We see
shadows, not the source. Our interpretations are projections, reconstructions,
guesses shaped by what little we observe. The true structure remains hidden.

[^WhatIsReality?]: Reality — all-there-is — is whatever you want to call it.
It includes everything you can think of, and everything you suspect exists but
do not consciously think about. Dictionaries offer definitions, but all are
partial.
[^Uncomputable]: In allegory to Plato’s cave: reality is unattainable in
principle; we see shadows. We call some sets of shadows “causes” and others
“effects.”
[^FatDebate]: Add citation: the historical distortion of nutrition science, the
masking of contrary data, and the persistence of a false consensus about fat and
sodium. Consensus-reality shapes what people believe is “real.”


### Energy Density

Within reality — the Node — subnodes interact. These interactions, if they
occur, are the only primitives. When awareness notices that one change reliably
precedes another, we call the first a “cause” and the second an “effect.” No
deeper scaffolding is assumed. Nothing is “in space.” Nothing “ticks” in time.
Only relational influence exists.

The “speed” at which a cause produces an effect is what we call the speed of
light. This is why nothing can go faster than light: it is a relational bound,
not a physical object racing through a void.

But the fundamental light speed, $c_0$, is not uniform everywhere. Things may
happen “faster” in one region of the Node than in another. As we discuss later,
Maxwell already shows the dependency of wave speed on energy density. But we are
getting ahead of ourselves.


### Orderings

From the primitive relation

$$ n_i \succ n_j $$

meaning “subnode $n_i$ causes $n_j$,” an emergent ordering arises: a before and
after.

Repeated causal loops function as clocks — obvious in any recurrent tick-tock.
Many types of clocks exist, some more accurate than others, but all rely on
recurrence.

By counting loops or causal steps, awareness defines durations. Time is not an
external parameter. It is an emergent count.

Distance emerges by tracking how many causal steps connect one subnode to
another. If a signal travels from $n_i$ to $n_j$ through a minimal chain of
length $L_{ij}$, then

$$
d(n_i, n_j) \propto L_{ij}.
$$

If no such path exists, distance is undefined or infinite. If the only path
returns to the same subnode, the round-trip count serves as an effective
separation. “Distance” is not a spatial coordinate but an operational measure of
causal separation.

In the companion work **Dimension and Space as Emergent Properties of Distance
in a Cause-Effect Model of the Emergence of Time**, these causal distances form
the basis of effective geometry. Observers attempt to embed subsets of subnodes
into Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^D$ such that Euclidean distances approximate
causal distances:

$$ \|\Phi(n_i) - \Phi(n_j)\| \approx d(n_i, n_j). $$

When such embeddings succeed with low distortion, observers perceive a
$D$-dimensional space. If multiple embeddings work, dimension is not unique. If
none work, geometry fails entirely. Thus, space and dimension are not
fundamental to the Node. They emerge from how awareness compresses relational
patterns.

What we call “geometry,” “space,” “time,” even “distance,” are not given. They
arise only after awareness encounters repeated causal patterns and organizes
them into stable expectations. Underneath is a flux of interactions in darkness.
Only through noticing do we conjure a world.
