## The ancients


![Euclid (fl. 4th century BCE)](assets/euclid.png)


Geometry is ancient. Long before physics existed as a discipline, geometric
relationships were studied as ideal forms: perfect lines, circles, and ratios.
By Euclid (~300 BCE), geometry had become an abstract deductive system,
independent of the imperfections of the physical world.

Debates about whether numbers or perfect forms “exist” continue even today.


## Plato

Plato saw geometry as belonging to a realm more real than the material world. In
the *Republic* (510d–511a) he says the objects of geometry are “eternal and
unchanging,” while the visible world offers only “images and shadows of the
true” (596a). Physical objects were, for him, approximations of exact
mathematical relations.

Modern psychology echoes this: humans routinely impose geometric structure on
ambiguous stimuli, as documented in Gestalt research (Wagemans et al., *Annual
Review of Psychology*, 2012).


## Descartes


![René Descartes (1596–1650)](assets/descartes.png)


Descartes preserved the ancient view of geometry as abstract but added a crucial
tool: analytic geometry. Coordinates allowed curves to be represented
algebraically, for example the circle

$$ x^2 + y^2 = r^2. $$

This linked algebra and geometry in a systematic way, though the full modern
formalism developed later.

Descartes did **not** propose space as an empty container. He denied the
existence of vacuum:


> “The extension in length, breadth, and depth which constitutes the nature of a
> body is the same as that which constitutes the nature of space.” — *Principles
> of Philosophy*, II, §10


Space was not a background independent of matter; it *was* the extension of
matter.


## Newton


![Isaac Newton (1642–1727)](assets/newton.png)


A major conceptual shift arrives with Newton. His work was not merely predictive
but grounded in a theological ontology. Newton saw the order of the heavens as
evidence of divine agency. In the General Scholium to the *Principia* he writes:


> “This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets could only proceed
> from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.” —
> *Principia*, General Scholium (1713)


On gravity:


> “Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain
> laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the
> consideration of my readers.” — Correspondence with Bentley, 1692


Newton did **not** insist that matter is literally structureless. In *Principia*
(Book I, Lemma I) he states it is **convenient** to treat bodies as points for
calculation. He believed matter had internal “least parts,” though he rejected
classical atomism and lacked a theory for the substructure.

To express gravitational influence, he introduced **absolute space and absolute
time**, grounding them in God’s creation:


> “Absolute space, in its own nature, without relation to anything external,
> remains always similar and immovable.” — *Principia*, Scholium


Yet Newton was uneasy with action-at-a-distance:


> “That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter… is to me so
> great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a
> competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.” — Letter to Bentley,
> 1692


The tension remained unresolved, but the calculational success was enormous.

From Newton, physics inherited a durable intuition: **objects are point-like
things with definite positions**, acted on by forces. What was originally a
mathematical convenience and theological framing hardened over time into a
literal ontology.


### Ether

As experiments improved, the point-mass ontology required a medium for wave
phenomena. Electromagnetic propagation demanded a substrate, so the ether was
proposed: stationary, invisible, and filling all space. It restored the idea of
a medium but remained undetected.


## Michelson–Morley

The Michelson–Morley experiment failed to detect motion through the ether.
Instead of discarding the point-mass framework, physics added another patch:
non-classical transformations that altered length and time.


![Albert A. Michelson (1852–1931)](assets/michelson.png)


Einstein removed the ether and replaced the background with spacetime geometry.
Special Relativity made the speed of light invariant; General Relativity
reinterpreted gravity as curvature. Yet the ontology remained: matter as
localized entities, points in a manifold.

## Part II.B — Fragmentation

The point-mass framework, extended by patches rather than replaced, produced a
physics divided against itself. Each major theory preserved part of the
Newtonian intuition while abandoning other parts, resulting in a set of mutually
incompatible descriptions of the world.


### Classical Mechanics


![Classical mechanics](assets/classical-mechanics.png)


Classical mechanics kept Newton’s ontology intact: point-masses with definite
positions, evolving in absolute space and time under continuous forces. This
picture works for planets, projectiles, and engineering, but fails for atoms,
radiation, and high velocities. It assumes trajectories exist, even when no
experiment can reveal them.


### Relativity


![Relativity](assets/relativity.png)


Relativity retained point-masses but discarded absolute space and absolute time.
Space and time became a single geometric structure, and gravity became
curvature. The ontology shifted: fields replaced forces, geometry replaced
background, but the particle remained a localized entity following a path in
spacetime.

Relativity cannot accommodate discrete jumps or probabilistic outcomes. Its
fundamental equations are smooth and deterministic.


### Quantum Theory


![Double-slit experiment](assets/double-slit.png)


Quantum theory abandoned definite positions but kept discreteness. A particle is
sometimes a point, sometimes a wave, depending on the experiment. Its evolution
is continuous until a measurement, at which point it “collapses” to a location.
Two incompatible rules govern the same entity.

Trajectories do not exist. Observables do not have definite values. The theory
succeeds in prediction but not in ontology.


### Quantum Field Theory


![Feynman diagram: electron-positron anhilitation producing photon.](assets/feynman-diagram.png)


Quantum Field Theory keeps relativity’s spacetime and quantum theory’s
probability amplitudes, but restores particles through quantized excitations of
fields. These excitations are treated as point-like for interactions. The
self-energy divergences that arise from point-like excitations require
renormalization — a successful mathematical procedure with no agreed physical
interpretation.

QFT unifies interactions mathematically, not ontologically. Locality, causality,
and discreteness coexist under tension.


### The Resulting Split

- Classical mechanics assumes continuous trajectories, time and space absolute.
- Relativity assumes smooth, continuous fields and a geometric background,
  spacetime relative to the observer, locally time-reversible.
- Quantum mechanics assumes quantized fields, probabilistic non-trajectory
  behavior, time-irreversible dynamics, incompatible with relativity.
- QFT assumes point-like excitations of continuous fields.

Each branch preserves one incompatible piece of the Newtonian heritage:
localization, smoothness, continuity, discreteness. None of them can be true
together in the same ontology.

This is the fragmentation produced by preserving the point-mass intuition:
multiple theories, each accurate in its domain, none capable of describing
reality as a unified whole.

The patches worked to some successful extent. The ontology did not.
