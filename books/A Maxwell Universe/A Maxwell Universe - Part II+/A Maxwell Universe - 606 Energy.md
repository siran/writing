## Energy Density

Within the Node, subnodes interact. These interactions are the only primitives.
When awareness notices that one transition reliably precedes another, we call
the first a “cause” and the second an “effect.” Nothing is “in space.” Nothing
“ticks” in time. Only relational influence exists.

The speed at which a cause produces an effect is what we call the speed of
light. Nothing can exceed it because it is a relational bound, not a moving
object’s velocity.

As a preview for later chapters, this fundamental cause–effect speed $c_0$ has
no requirement to be uniform everywhere [^FundamentalC]. Things may happen
faster or slower in different regions of the Node. Maxwell’s equations already
show that wave speed depends on energy density, as in a dielectric. Further
details come later.

[^FundamentalC]: If certain subnodes behave according to Maxwell’s equations,
the effective propagation speed depends on local energy density. Written plainly,
this is unsurprising: energy alters how fast things happen.
