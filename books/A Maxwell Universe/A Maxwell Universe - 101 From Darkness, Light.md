## 1. From Darkness, Light

Reality begins not with space or time, but with the simple fact that events
happen.

We often assume events happen for a reason. This doesn't need to be so, and even
if it is, we don't have direct access to the causal information, but indirect
through its effects.

A reason is a story added later. What matters is simply that a change occurs and
that it can be registered in a way that affects our state. Once a change is
registered, two states can be distinguished: “before” and “after.” That
distinction *is* the event. Here we don't appeal to an "intelligence recording
an event," but simply to a mark, like a scratch on a table, that affects the
object's state. It denotes only the minimal capacity to register change.

The sense of reason or explanation arises only as a reactive story as way of
organizing transitions once change has been noticed by a reasoning entity (topic
which we will address later in [@EmergenceOfSelf]).


This reactivity is not limited to conscious minds. Anything that changes in
response to causes and produces effects is, in this minimal sense,
**operationally aware** [^OperationalAwareness]. A self-sustaining causal loop
qualifies: it updates its own state in response to incoming influences. By doing
so, it distinguishes states and tracks transitions—not through any “plan of
action,” which would imply a consciousness we have not defined, but simply by
virtue of its continued existence as a loop. In this minimal operational sense,
a self-sustaining causal loop “notices” change.

## 2. Time

Time is, thus, a construct: a tool operational awareness uses to organize its
state. Each loop forms its own internal notion of time. Yet we maintain
collective agreements: certain event-patterns (“causes”) tend to precede others
(“effects”). Those who do not share the prevailing interpretation are often
labeled “irrational,” though this only reflects different mappings between
change and order.

We may picture “reality” [^WhatIsReality?] as a Node with an unknowable internal
structure [^Uncomputable]. All we know is that this structure reproduces
patterns of transitions from which we infer “before” and “after.”

What we call the past is reconstructed now, from present evidence. If new
evidence appears, our reconstruction may shift. The long debate about whether
dietary fat was harmful or beneficial is a familiar example later shown to rest
on selective data [^FatDebate]. Consensus reality is fragile. Without external
anchors, interpretations feel arbitrary, raising the persistent question: what
is real?


## 3. Orderings

From the primitive relation

$$ n_i \succ n_j, $$

meaning “subnode $n_i$ causes $n_j$,” an ordering arises: before and after. We
may call this succession of events $i$ and $j$ a **causal step**.

A series of events forms a **causal chain**: i → a → b → c → d → j.

Chains can form loops:

... → j → i → a → b → c → j → i → ...

and may cross themselves without restriction. A loop is considered “closed” when
its pattern stabilizes in some useful sense.

Repeated causal loops can function as clocks. Any recurrent sequence can serve
as a clock. Accuracy varies, but recurrence suffices.

Note that an effect that produces no further causes marks the end of a causal
chain. Such an endpoint cannot be registered—there is no return influence.
Therefore the fact that anything is noticed at all implies that the noticer is,
in essence, a self-sustaining causal loop.


## 4. Counting Steps

By counting loops or causal steps, operational awareness defines durations. Time
is an emergent count, not an external parameter.

Distance emerges by tracking how many causal steps connect two subnodes. If a
signal travels from $n_i$ to $n_j$ through a minimal chain of length $L_{ij}$,
then

$$
d(n_i, n_j) \propto L_{ij}.
$$

If no path exists, distance is infinite or undefined. If the only path returns
to the same subnode, the round-trip count becomes an effective measure of
separation. Distance is not a spatial coordinate but an operational measure of
causal separation.

In the companion work *Dimension and Space as Emergent Properties of Distance in
a Cause-Effect Model of the Emergence of Time*, these causal distances define an
effective geometry. Observers attempt to embed subsets of subnodes into
Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^D$ such that Euclidean distances approximate causal
distances:

$$ \|\Phi(n_i) - \Phi(n_j)\| \approx d(n_i, n_j). $$

When such embeddings succeed with low distortion, observers perceive a
$D$-dimensional space. If multiple embeddings work, dimension is not unique. If
none succeed, geometry fails. Space and dimension are not fundamental. They
emerge from how operational awareness compresses relational patterns.

Geometry, space, time, and distance arise only after repeated causal patterns
are registered and organized into stable expectations. Beneath this lies a flux
of interactions in darkness. Registration of change shapes a world.


## 5. Space

Distance is always one-dimensional: a single count of causal steps between two
events. What we call “space” is the union of all such distances. By collecting
every pairwise separation into a single structure, operational awareness
attempts to form a coherent geometric picture.

If the full set of distances can be embedded with low distortion into some
$\mathbb{R}^D$, we say the Node appears $D$-dimensional. If it cannot, the
resulting “space” may have no consistent dimension at all.

Structure is therefore emergent. If a set of events fits a “square embedding,”
observers perceive a square. The same pattern might be interpreted as a point, a
surface, or a thin slice of a volume. Structure depends on how relational
patterns are compressed, not on an intrinsic geometry underneath.


## 6. Plato and the Cave

Plato illustrated the limits of our access to reality. We see shadows, not the
source. Our interpretations are reconstructions shaped by limited observation.
There is no external vantage point from which the true structure can be viewed.
We infer what we can from patterns alone.

[^WhatIsReality?]: Reality—“all that is”—includes everything you can think of
and everything you suspect exists but do not consciously consider. Any formal
definition is partial.

[^Uncomputable]: As in Plato’s cave: the underlying structure is inaccessible in
principle. We see only shadows and name some “causes” and others “effects.”

[^FatDebate]: Late-20th-century nutrition science framed fat as the main cause of
heart disease, but later reviews showed selective reporting and industry
influence. Contradictory data had been minimized. Re-analysis revealed a weaker
link than claimed, showing how consensus can form around distorted evidence.
