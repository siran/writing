# PART I — FOUNDATIONS OF REALITY

## 1. Darkness : cause–effect as the only primitive

“There is only cause-and-effect relations… these relations define everything
that follows.”

[A Cause-Effect Model for Emergent Time and
Distance](https://preferredframe.com/prints/doi/10.5281/zenodo.17613402/)


## 2. Emergent Space : distance from causal steps

“Distance is the count of causal steps… space arises from distances.”

[Dimension and Space as Emergent Properties of Distance in a Cause-Effect Model
of the Emergence of
Time](https://preferredframe.com/prints/doi/10.5281/zenodo.17633950/)


## 3. Universal Causal Substrate : any dimension, dense subnodes, all consistent theories encodable

“Given a dense set of subnodes, any causal pattern can be represented… dimension
emerges as a best-fit description, not a primitive one.”

Any theory that honors cause-effect can be encoded in the Node framework.


## 4. Time Forks : point-mass, field, and spiritual ontologies

“The order in which ontologies arise changes the world that is built from them…
different causal framings generate different realities.”


# PART II — THE POINT-MASS PATH

## 5A. Newtonian Lineage : Newton → Ether → Michelson–Morley → SR/GR → Quantum patches

“The point-mass picture was assumed fundamental… and later required additional
layers—relativity, quantum rules—to patch inconsistencies.”


## 5B. Fragmentation : mechanics, relativity, quantum split into branches

“Mechanics, relativity, and quantum theory arise as separate branches because
the underlying ontology was never unified.”


# PART III — A MAXWELL ONTOLOGY

## 6. Maxwell Ontology : derive Newton from Maxwell

“Local energy gradients lead to an effective refractive geometry… producing a
1/r² force law equivalent to Newtonian attraction.”


## 7. Rydberg Series : EM standing waves on toroidal surfaces

“Toroidal standing modes of Maxwell’s equations form quantized states with
discrete energies… producing hydrogen-like spectral series.”


## 8. Photon as Torus : opposing circulations; decomposition

“Opposing circulations in a toroidal EM configuration generate a standing-wave
photon… with internal counter-rotating energy loops.”


## 9. Toroidal Shells : (m,n) flows, 1/r² decay, topological charge

“(m,n) winding flows create layered toroidal shells whose energy density decays
as 1/r²… the winding numbers act as conserved topological charges.”


# PART IV — QUANTUM WITHOUT QUANTUM

## 10. No Quantum, No Collapse : PCF deterministic branching

“There is no collapse; the field branches deterministically… all outcomes are
energy partitions of one real field.”


## 11. Schrödinger from Maxwell : slow-envelope dynamics

“The narrowband envelope of a Maxwell mode obeys the Schrödinger equation… with
mass and ℏ arising from the mode energy and frequency.”


## 12. Energy Fractions : probability as energy distribution

“Probability is the fraction of total field energy in each branch… the Born rule
is energy accounting.”


## 13. Finite Environments : deviations from Born statistics

“In a finite-mode environment the branch energies fluctuate… producing
measurable deviations from Born statistics.”


# PART V — GRAVITATION & LARGE-SCALE PHYSICS

## 14. Energy–Energy as Gravity : refractive geometry

“Energy modifies the local propagation speed… gradients of energy density act as
gravitational geometry.”


## 15. Maxwellian Relativity : Lorentz symmetry and curvature emerging from medium

“Wave propagation in a structured EM medium selects Lorentz symmetry… curvature
arises from spatial variation of the effective speed of light.”


# PART VI — TOPOLOGY, MIND, AND EMERGENCE

## 16. In-Out Meta-Structure : inversion loop and self-reference

“The in–out inversion appears across scales… forming the basis for the
self-referential structure of cognition.”


## 17. Mode Aggregation : collective (m,n) frequencies and black-body spectrum

“Aggregated (m,n) modes vibrate collectively, producing a continuous energy
spectrum consistent with black-body radiation.”


# PART VII — THERMODYNAMICS & COSMOLOGY

## 18. Thermodynamics and End-State : dipole minimum; Gaussian flux = 0

“The minimal stable structure is a dipole; once energy reaches this
configuration, further decay ends because net Gaussian flux is zero.”
