Part II traces the evolution of different understandings of space, from early
relational notions to the space-as-container picture most people now assume. It
is not a complete historical account, but a selection of ideas that shaped how
space, matter, and structure came to be described.

The history can be seen as a sequence of serendipitous developments—sometimes
mutually incompatible—that together produced an increasingly accurate
description of experience. From ancient thinkers, through Descartes and Newton,
to modern theories, each step preserved convenient assumptions while extending
their domain of applicability.

Yet if the experiences that led to the abstraction of Maxwell’s equations had
appeared earlier, before the point-mass and point-charge intuitions had taken
root, we might think of matter very differently. We would see it as a stable
electromagnetic configuration with inertia, not as a distinct substance called
“mass.” Charge, too, would not be an intrinsic primitive but an emergent
property of structured energy flow. Objects would be extended rather than
punctual.

Many assume that Maxwell’s equations, being continuous and classical, cannot
produce discrete (“quantum”) effects. But discreteness does not require a
non-classical theory. It can arise from topology.

Consider a standing electromagnetic wave on the surface of a torus in a
source-free Maxwell universe. Such a configuration admits two winding numbers
$(m,n)$: the poloidal and toroidal cycles of the Poynting flow. These integers
count how many times energy wraps around each independent loop of the torus. A
$(1,1)$ mode wraps once around each hole; a $(2,1)$ mode wraps twice around one
hole and once around the other. A standing wave is obtained from opposing
counter-circulating flows.

In a source-free universe,

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0, \qquad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,
$$

and therefore the Gaussian flux of $\mathbf{E}$ or $\mathbf{B}$ across any
closed surface is zero.

Even so, nothing prevents non-zero *tangential* flow along the toroidal surface.
This flow is proportional to the total energy $E(m,n)$ of the standing wave.
For a shell at radius $r$ surrounding the configuration, the magnitude of the
tangential flow scales as

$$
\propto \frac{E(m,n)}{\text{surface area at radius } r}
\propto \frac{E(m,n)}{r^2}.
$$

Thus, a radial $1/r^2$ decay profile—indistinguishable from that of an electric
charge—is recovered without postulating any source. The “charge” is not a
fundamental entity but the measurement of diluted tangential flow from a
topologically quantized electromagnetic configuration.

As later chapters will show, this mechanism allows us to recover the full
structure of electromagnetism *with* sources, but with the sources now
understood as emergent rather than fundamental.
