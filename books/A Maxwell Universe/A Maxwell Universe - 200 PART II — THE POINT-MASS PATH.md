## Summary of Part II — The Point-Mass Path

Part II traces how the point-mass picture—and later its conceptual descendant,
the point-charge—became the default ontology of physics. Geometry began as an
abstract study of ideal forms. With Descartes, it became algebraic. With Newton,
it became the stage on which bodies—treated as mathematical points—moved under
forces in absolute space and absolute time.

What began as a calculational device gradually hardened into an assumption about
the nature of matter and charge, assigning them distinct fundamental substances
with ad-hoc or undefined properties.

As new phenomena appeared, theoretical frameworks accumulated patches: first an
ether to support waves, then revised notions of motion and measurement when the
ether failed to appear, and later additional constructs to reconcile point-like
objects with extended wave behavior. Each step preserved the point-mass
intuition instead of questioning it. Space and time were reshaped to maintain
this view—an attestation to our confidence in our own assumptions.

The result was a successful descriptive framework built from inherited
conveniences rather than from a deeper account of nature. The point-mass model
simplified calculation and produced accurate predictions, but it also obscured
underlying dynamics and introduced interpretation problems that did not
originate in nature.

Part II shows how the order in which these assumptions emerged shaped our
picture of reality and our expectations of how it behaves.
