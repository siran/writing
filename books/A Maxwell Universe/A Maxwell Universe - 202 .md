## Geometry Before and the Point-Mass

### The ancients

Geometry is ancient. Long before physics existed as a discipline, geometric
relationships were studied as ideal objects: perfect lines, circles, and
proportions. By the time of Euclid (~300 BCE), geometry had become a formal
deductive system: abstract, exact, and independent of the physical world's
imperfections.

Even today we still debate whether numbers “exist,” or whether a perfect circle
is real or only an idea.


### Plato

Plato considered geometry to exist in a “higher realm,” with the physical world
only approximating its purity. As he wrote, “the objects of geometry are eternal
and unchanging” (*Republic* 510d–511a), and the visible world contains only
“images and shadows of the true” (*Republic* 596a). Whether an idea is “real” we
cannot prove, but we can certainly approximate these ideas using events.

Humans routinely identify geometric patterns in random stimuli; this is well
documented in Gestalt psychology, which shows our strong bias to impose simple
geometric structure on ambiguous input (Wagemans et al., *Annual Review of
Psychology*, 2012).

For Plato, geometry belonged to a realm more real than the material world.
Physical objects were degraded projections of perfect mathematical relations. In
this view, geometry is not derived from the world; the world participates in
geometry.


### Descartes

Descartes accepted the ancient notion of geometry as an abstract structure, but
introduced a powerful new tool: the idea of coordinate systems that allowed
geometry to be expressed symbolically and manipulated algebraically. A curve
could now be described by an equation; geometry translated into numbers.

For example:


> A circle of radius \(r\) centered at the origin is described by \(x^2 + y^2 =
> r^2\).


This transformation unified algebra and geometry.

On the matter of "what space is?", Descartes did **not** propose a
container-like space. That idea came later. For Descartes, there is no empty
void. “The extension in length, breadth, and depth which constitutes the nature
of a body is the same as that which constitutes the nature of space”
(*Principles of Philosophy*, II, §10), and therefore “there can be no such thing
as a vacuum” (*Principles*, II, §16).

Geometry, for Descartes, describes extension itself rather than a background
that exists even when bodies do not.


### Newton

The idea of space as a container begins with Newton.

For the first time in Western physics, space became a **real, independent
container**: absolute, uniform, existing even if no objects occupy it. Matter
was reduced to point-masses, without structure or internal mechanism, moving
inside this container according to forces acting at a distance.

The abstract geometry of Euclid, and the relational extension of Descartes, were
replaced by a physical stage on which events unfold.

This Newtonian move transformed geometry from an abstract language into a
physical ontology. It is this point-mass–in-container picture that later
required increasing layers of patches. These patches came in the form of human
constructs, some rooted in experiments, other in postulates; all sharing the
point-mass or point-charge constructs. This is not in any way a criticism of a
the extremely useful worldview that Newton and others shared with us. It is more
of an acknowlegments of the limits of the model, and the unnecesary mysteries we
put ourselves subject to.

remain consistent with experiments. It marked a fundamental departure from the
ancient and Cartesian relational views, yet produced extraordinarily successful
predictions.

From Newton, physics inherited a simple intuition: things are *objects* with
definite positions. From this, the point-mass model took hold.

Newton formalized motion and gravitation using point particles interacting at a
distance. This required no explicit medium; action-at-a-distance was (and still
is) an unexamined primitive. Forces were encoded algebraically rather than
explained mechanistically. In many ways the map displaced the territory: we
introduced problems rather than solved them—self-energy of point objects, and
the mystery of wavefunction collapse in Quantum Mechanics.

As experimental precision grew, the absence of a medium became problematic.
Waves require a substrate, so an ether was proposed: a stationary, undetectable
medium intended to support electromagnetic propagation.


### Michelson–Morley

Michelson–Morley exposed the contradiction. If light propagated through an
ether, motion relative to that medium should be detectable. It was not. The
point-mass model now required a new patch: velocities must transform in a
non-classical way.

Einstein replaced the ether with spacetime geometry. Special Relativity made the
speed of light invariant; General Relativity encoded gravity as curvature. These
worked, but the ontology of “mass points in a curved manifold” retained the
original assumption: matter as discrete localized entities.

Quantum theory fractured the picture further. Particles became both points *and*
waves. Collapse added a special rule. Fields were introduced yet still quantized
as point-like excitations. Layer after layer of corrections accumulated to
preserve the point-mass intuition.

This lineage—Newton → Ether → Relativity → Quantum—reveals a pattern: each step
introduces a new patch to reconcile deeper inconsistencies. The point-mass
ontology survives only through continuous repair.
