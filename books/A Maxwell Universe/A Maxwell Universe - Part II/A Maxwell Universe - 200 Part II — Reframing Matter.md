# Fields Matter

This part does not introduce new equations, new forces, or new postulates. It
revisits familiar results under a single restriction: **only source-free Maxwell
dynamics are assumed**.

Throughout this work, “particle”, “mass”, and “charge” are names given to
self-confined, self-sustained electromagnetic field configurations. They are not
assumed as microscopic primitives.

This text does not proceed by axioms and deductions, but by re-anchoring
familiar results in a different ontology. The order reflects conceptual
recognition rather than pedagogical construction.

The guiding observation is simple: **the same equations already contain more
structure than we usually allow ourselves to see.**

Discrete spectra, inertia, charge, and stability appear not as added principles,
but as consequences of global closure, continuity, and energy flows governed by
source-free Maxwell equations in free space, and energy conservation in a
Maxwell Universe.

The Rydberg series is taken as the point of entry as direct evidence that
electromagnetic fields, when globally constrained, can organize energy
discretely without invoking quantum mechanics postulates (particles, measurement
collapse, wave-particle, symmtries, probability clouds), extra or wrapped
dimensions, ungrounded or mysterious ideas, forces, etc.

From this anchor, the remaining properties of matter —mass, motion, charge, and
stability— are traced back to the same source:
**electromagnetic energy constrained to close on itself.**
