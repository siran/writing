# Appendix A: Newton’s Method

Throughout this text, we have argued that mass is an operational parameter—a
coefficient of change—rather than a primitive substance. To see why this
distinction matters, it helps to look at how Isaac Newton actually formulated
his dynamics.

Modern textbooks condense Newton’s Second Law into the crisp algebraic equation

$$
F = ma.
$$

Newton does not present the law in this algebraic form. In the *Principia* he
states it verbally:


> “The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed…”


:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

And he frames the whole work in a classical geometric style. Newton even says
explicitly why he does this:


> “…to avoid disputes about the method of fluxions, I have composed the
> demonstrations… in a geometrical way…”


:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

So the *Principia* is not “algebra-first physics.” It is *geometry-first
physics*, with the calculus largely kept out of view.


## The Hidden Calculus

Newton’s dynamics are powered by a flow-based view of quantities. In his own
words (in the *intended preface* / fluxional framing):


> “Quantities increasing by continuous flow we call fluents, the speeds of
> flowing we call fluxions and the momentary increments we call moments.”


:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

This is the stance: reality is described as *generation by flow*, and the
mathematics is about how flows relate.

That is exactly the intuition behind the “moment” computation you outline
($x \mapsto x+\dot{x}o$; discard higher order in $o$). Whatever notation we use
today, Newton’s idea is: take the relation, advance by a vanishing moment, and
keep only what survives as the moment goes to zero.


## Mass as a Coefficient of Flow

Newton introduces “quantity of matter” (mass) as a *measurable factor* that lets
motion be accounted for consistently. His basic operational definition of matter
already reads like a recipe:


> “Quantity of matter is the measure of the same, arising from its density and
> bulk conjointly.”


:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Then, crucially, he defines *quantity of motion* (momentum) as a product-like
measure:


> “The quantity of motion is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity
> and quantity of matter conjointly.”


:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

So mass is not introduced as mystical “stuff.” It enters as the coefficient
needed so that “motion” (momentum) scales with velocity in the right way.

In that precise sense: **dynamics comes first; mass is the invented coefficient
that linearizes the bookkeeping of change.**

In a Maxwell Universe, we return to this priority. The fundamental “flow” is
electromagnetic energy–momentum flow. What we call “mass” is the effective
resistance to changing that flow—arising when flux is knotted into a stable
topology.
