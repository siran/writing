## The Boundary Problem

We have established that matter can be viewed as a knotted, self-consistent
electromagnetic field. We have also seen that such configurations naturally
possess inertia and discrete spectra.

But a critical question remains: **Why doesn't the energy leak out?**

In standard Maxwell theory, light waves spread. A localized packet of energy in
a vacuum tends to disperse. What mechanism confines this energy into a stable,
persistent knot that we recognize as an electron or a proton?

The answer lies in **Impedance**.


## The Impedance of Space

The vacuum is not an empty stage; it has rigid electromagnetic properties. It
resists the formation of fields. This resistance is quantified by the ratio
between $\mu_0$ and $\epsilon_0$, also known as the "Characteristic Impedance of
Free Space", $Z_0$:

$$
Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \approx 376.7 \, \Omega.
$$

Any electromagnetic wave traveling through the vacuum is governed by this ratio
between the electric field $|\mathbf{E}|$ and the magnetic field $|\mathbf{H}|$.

Now, consider our knotted configuration—the torus. This object acts effectively
as a **waveguide**: a closed loop in which electromagnetic energy circulates.

Like any transmission line or waveguide, this knot has its own *intrinsic
impedance*, $Z_{\text{knot}}$, determined entirely by its geometry (the ratio of
the toroidal to poloidal radii).


## Stability via Mismatch

It is well understood that when an electromagnetic wave encounters a boundary
between two media of different impedances, a portion of the wave is reflected,
and a portion is transmitted.

If the impedance match is perfect, energy flows freely (a boundary is defined by
impedance mismatch). If the impedance mismatch is infinite, the reflection is
perfect.

For a particle to be stable—to be "self-contained"—the energy circulating within
the knot must be trapped by a massive impedance mismatch with the surrounding
vacuum. This is analogous to **Total Internal Reflection** in optics. The field
"bounces" off the boundary of its energetic meander, unable to flow away.


## The Fine Structure Constant

However, the reflection is never quite perfect. If it were, matter would be
completely decoupled from the rest of the universe—invisible and intangible.

There is a slight leakage. A tiny fraction of the internal energy couples to the
vacuum. We perceive this leakage as the ability of the particle to interact: its
**charge**.

This brings us to one of the most famous and mysterious numbers in physics: the
Fine Structure Constant, $\alpha \approx 1/137$.

In the standard view, $\alpha$ is an arbitrary parameter that sets the strength
of the electromagnetic interaction. In a Maxwell Universe, $\alpha$ has a
geometric interpretation. It is the ratio of the impedance of the vacuum to the
impedance of the knot.

Using the Von Klitzing constant $R_K = h/e^2$, we can express $\alpha$ as:

$$
\alpha = \frac{Z_0}{2 R_K}.
$$

If we identify the intrinsic impedance of the fundamental knot (the electron)
with the quantum of resistance $R_K$, the fine structure constant becomes simply
a measure of the impedance mismatch:

$$
\alpha = \frac{Z_0}{2 Z_{\text{knot}}}.
$$

Matter is stable because $Z_{\text{knot}}$ is vastly different from $Z_0$. The
"leakage" that manages to bridge this gap is what we call the electric charge
$e$.

Thus, stability and interaction are two sides of the same coin: the impedance
contrast between the geometry of matter and the geometry of the vacuum.


## Knots vs. Links

If the electron is the simplest stable standing wave—a single flux tube wound
tightly into a torus ($n=1$)—then what is a proton?

Standard physics tells us the proton is not elementary; it is composed of three
"quarks." Yet, these parts can never be separated.

In a Maxwell Universe, this distinction is topological.

* **The Electron is a Knot:** A single closed loop of energy.
* **The Proton is a Link:** Multiple closed loops of energy that thread
    through each other.


## The Logic of Confinement

Consider three smoke rings (flux tubes) linked together in a Borromean
configuration. No single ring is connected to the others, yet the group cannot
come apart.

*Borromean rings*

To separate them, one would have to "cut" a field line—an act that requires
overcoming the immense impedance of the vacuum (creating a magnetic monopole
singularity, which is forbidden or energetically prohibitive).

This topological interlocking creates a structure that is:
1.  **Composite:** It has internal parts (the individual loops).
2.  **Stable:** The parts are mechanically locked together.
3.  **Confined:** The parts cannot exist in isolation.

In this view, the "Strong Nuclear Force" is not a separate fundamental force.
It is simply the **topology of linking**. The "force" that holds the proton
together is the same robustness that holds a chain together: geometry.


## Mass and Curvature

Why is the proton 1,836 times heavier than the electron?

To link three flux tubes together within a sub-atomic volume requires
significantly tighter curvature than a single loop. Tighter curvature implies
higher frequency, higher energy density, and therefore—via $E=mc^2$—higher mass.

The proton is massive not because it contains "heavy stuff," but because it is a
knot of extreme topological complexity, pulled tight.
