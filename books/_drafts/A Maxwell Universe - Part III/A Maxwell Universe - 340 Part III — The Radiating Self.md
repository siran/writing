# The Radiating Self

If the "Self" steers the body, and the body is an electrical machine, then the
"Self" does not stop at the skin. It radiates.


## The Body as an Antenna

The human body is a **Phased Array Dipole Emitter**.
* **The Heart:** A magnetic toroid generator ($\sim 50 \mu\text{A}$).
* **The Spine:** A linear transmission line ($\sim 1 \text{ m}$).
* **The Result:** We are continuously broadcasting our internal state into the
  vacuum.


## Derivation of Influence (The Field Radius)

Calculating the electric field $E$ of a synchronized neural/heart pulse ($1 \text{ mA}$ at $10 \text{ Hz}$):
$$
E \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ V/m} \quad (\text{at } r=1\text{m})
$$

What does this field do? Previous calculations suggested it could drag a single
electron 360 meters in a vacuum. The critique is that in matter, the electron
hits an atom instantly.

**The Rebuttal:** The electron does not need to travel 360 meters. The **Field**
extends 360 meters.
* Within that sphere, **every single electron** feels the bias of your Will.
* You are not pushing one rock; you are applying a polarized bias to an ocean of
  charge.


## The Mechanism: Stochastic Resonance

How does a weak Will move a heavy World? Through **Stochastic Resonance**. We do
not overpower the noise. We **bias** it.

* We do not claim single-event causation. You cannot "push" a glass across a
  table.
* We claim **Statistical Drift**. A small, periodic nudge (The Individual Will)
  applied to a noisy system can steer the system's evolution **over time**.
* We do not "force" the glass to move. We tilt the probability field so that the
  "Random" vibrations of the universe statistically drift in our direction.


## The Phantom Experiment (Falsification)

We propose a test to prove this broadcast exists. **The Setup:** A Torsion
Balance (ultra-sensitive mass) in a vacuum. **The Subject:** A human (or
mechanical phantom) broadcasting a coherent 10 Hz signal. **The Prediction:**
The balance will not move linearly. It will exhibit a **Biased Brownian
Motion**. The "random" jitter of the balance will statistically drift away from
the source of the Will over long integration times.

But if this field exists, why is it so weak? Why can't we levitate objects? The
answer requires us to confront the most common objection to this theory: **The
Statistical Fallacy**.
