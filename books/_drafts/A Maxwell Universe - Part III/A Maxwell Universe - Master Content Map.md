# A Maxwell Universe: Master Content Map

**Project Status:** Canon (Parts I & II) / Polished Draft (Parts III, IV, V)

**Abstract:** This work proposes a unified ontology where reality is a single,
continuous electromagnetic substrate.
* **Part I & II:** Establish the physical baseline—deriving Mass, Charge, and
  Gravity from the topology of a source-free scalar field.
* **Part III:** Derives the "Self" not as a biological accident, but as a
  **Causally Free** electromagnetic structure emerging from the substrate (The
  Ghost in the Machine).
* **Part IV & V:** Explores the sociology of the field—how "Ideas" exist as
  topological constraints and how the "Consensus" of billions of observers
  renders the macroscopic world (The Physics of Society).

## PART III — THE EMERGENT GHOST (Polished Draft)

*Focus: How the Individual Self emerges from the Loop.*
1. **The Causally Free** (Software): Ideas as acausal, logical constraints.
2. **The Hardware of Resonance** (Hardware): Microtubules as shielded waveguides
   ($M < 10$).
3. **The Mechanism of Choice** (Filter): The PCF and Subtractive Free Will.
4. **The Radiating Self** (Output): The body as a phased array; bias vs. force.
5. **The Statistical Fallacy** (Defense): Refuting Thermal Noise via Phase
   Coherence.


## PART IV — THE PHYSICS OF IDEAS (Polished Draft)

*Focus: The Ecosystem of Thought and Object.*
1. **The Physics of Objects** (Signatures): Impedance matching as recognition.
2. **Material Platonism** (Idea Clouds): Ideas as topological constraints /
   superposition of imprints.


## PART V — THE PHYSICS OF CONSENSUS (Polished Draft)

*Focus: How we render the Universe together.*
1. **The Physics of Consensus** (Network): Institutions as Hyper-Constructs
   (Macro-Solitons).
2. **The Render** (Conclusion): The Universe as a Volumetric Display (The CRT
   Universe).
