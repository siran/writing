In Part I, we established that we never touch the causal substrate of the
universe; we interact only with its effects. We described a “self-sustaining
causal loop” as a chain of events $(i \rightarrow a \rightarrow b \rightarrow
i)$. We thus established that “existence is persistence”: events that do not
cause further effects are effectively non-existent.

The persistence of the loop raises an immediate question: is the loop entirely
at the mercy of the causal substrate? At first glance, yes. The loop depends on
the causal substrate producing the same effects from the same causes. If the
rules change, the loop changes.

However, loops of sufficient complexity can generate *imprints*.

An imprint is like a cul-de-sac branching from a main road: it can be removed
without destroying the road, yet its presence alters traffic patterns. It is an
internal record that is not required for the loop’s persistence, but that alters
the loop's evolution.


## Imprints and Steering

An imprint is produced causally, but once established, it is shielded from
direct coupling to causes external to the loop by the loop’s closure.

This shielding is not metaphysical; it is structural. Just as a roof shields a
table from the rain, the loop’s closure shields the imprint from the
fine-grained causal "turbulence" of the substrate.

Crucially, the imprint feeds back into the loop. If it did not, it would not
function as an imprint of that loop. It steers the evolution of the loop. It
does not force future states but it biases transitions. By altering which
internal paths are accessible, the imprint shapes the loop's evolution without
breaking causal closure.

An amoeba and a human both are self-sustaining loops. The difference lies in the
degree to which internal imprints are generated and consulted to steer the
future. DNA is a familiar example of an imprint that maintains structure across
the loop's persistence. Other imprints live inside us, but are not so evident
nor figurative. An imprint can also be encoded in brain waves, for example, as
we'll propose later.


## The Meta-Layer

Consider the concept of "a circle."

* A physical ring (a tire) is causally bound. It interacts with the road; it
  ages; it breaks.

* The *idea* of a circle interacts with nothing. It has no mass, no charge, and
  no temperature.

Yet, it exists. It is a "meta-layer" structure — an internal causal structure
that steers the loop, much like software can steer hardware. Once formed, it is
decoupled from the mechanics external to the loop. The definition of a circle
does not age. It does not decay. It rides atop the physical world.


## Acausal Determinism

If these ideas are free from physical laws, are they chaotic? No. They are also
governed by another form of necessity: logical implication.

* The physical substrate is governed by "changes of state" (state $t$ leads to
  state $t+1$).

* The meta-layer is governed by necessity or implication (Axiom $A$ necessitates
  Conclusion $B$).

In humans, failure to adhere to an internal imprint can cause what some call
"cognitive dissonance".

This is **Acausal Determinism**. If you accept the axioms of Euclidean geometry
(the imprint), you *must* accept that the angles of a triangle sum to 180
degrees (or the loop’s internal consistency breaks). This "must" is not a
physical force. No electron is pushing you to agree. It is a logical
inevitability that exists outside of time. This necessity is enforced by the
loop’s continued consultation of the imprint. In this way, imprints steer the
evolution of the loop according to internal constraints, without invoking
physical force.


## The Origin of the Ghost

How does a causal universe produce acausal things? It happens when a system
stops reacting directly to the world and starts reacting to internal models.

A simple thermostat is causally bound: it reacts to heat (substrate). A human
mind reacts to projected futures (imprints).

When the mind simulates a future ("If I walk off the cliff, I will fall"), it is
interacting with a ghost. The "fall" has not happened. The "cliff" in the mind
is made of imprints, not stone. The simulation is causally free from the actual
gravity of the earth. Yet, this simulation determines the body's motion. The
imprint of the fall steers its causal substrate, the loop.


## The Self as an Idea

This brings us to the ultimate ghost: the self.

We feel “free” because we are. We are not free from the laws of physics; our
bodies are perfectly bound to the substrate (more about this in later sections).
We are free because “we” are not bodies.

"I" is an Idea. "I" is a causally free construct — a collection of memories,
expectations, and logical narratives. Like the Circle, the "Self" does not have
a temperature or a location. It is a pattern.

And like the circle, it is acausally deterministic. We do not act randomly. We
act according to the rigid logic of the story we have told ourselves. If the
"self" is defined as "a good person," then when faced with a crime, the system
*must* intervene. Not because physics forces it, but because the logic of the
Imprint demands it.
