# Material Platonism (Idea Clouds)

If the vacuum is full of noise (Other Wills), how do stable ideas exist? If a
physical cup emits a signature, what about a non-physical idea? What is the
signature of "Justice"?


## Justice as a Field

We previously defined "Justice" as a Soliton. We now refine this. Justice is not
a single object. It is a **Superposition of Imprints.**

* Every time a human act creates a "Just" outcome, it broadcasts a specific
  geometric signature (an Imprint) into the field.
* Over thousands of years, billions of these Imprints occupy the same phase
  space.
* They constructively interfere to form a **Net Instantaneous Field**.

"Justice" is the standing wave created by the sum of all just acts in history.
It is a **Probability Field** that exerts pressure on the present to conform to
the average of the past.


## The Rain (Infection)

When we "have an idea," we are not creating it. We are tuning into this Net
Field.
* The "Idea" is the topological constraint formed by the history of the species.
* When our internal microtubule array resonates with this field, we feel the
  "Moral Imperative." We are literally vibrating in sync with the summed will of
  our ancestors.


## The Biology of Morality (Squirrel Justice)

This resolves the debate of Nature vs. Nurture. Biologists observe that
squirrels share nuts and monkeys reject unfair pay. They exhibit a primitive
sense of "Fairness."

Did the squirrels read a philosophy book? No. The "Fairness Field" exists in the
environment. It is a fundamental harmonic of social interaction.
* The Human Brain (High Bandwidth) resolves this Field into a Legal Code.
* The Squirrel Brain (Low Bandwidth) resolves it into "Share the Nut."

They are tuning to the same station. The Idea precedes the Thinker.
